Guide OverviewTuri Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You\ndon't have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object\ndetection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to\nyour app.Easy-to-use: Focus on tasks instead of algorithms\n\nVisual: Built-in, streaming visualizations to explore your data\n\nFlexible: Supports text, images, audio, video and sensor data\n\nFast and Scalable: Work with large datasets on a single machine\n\nReady To Deploy: Export models to Core ML for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps\n\nAs you use Turi Create in your work, reference this guide to understand:Data ingestion and cleaning with SFrames (and their data-type-specific equivalents)\n\nBasics of predictive model development: algorithm- and application-based toolkits\n\nHow to evaluate, visualize, and improve upon your model\n\nIf you haven’t already installed Turi Create, you can find instructions\nhere.SFrameSFrame is a scalable, tabular, column-mutable dataframe object. The data\nin SFrame is stored column-wise, and is stored\non persistent storage (e.g. disk) to avoid being constrained by memory\nsize. Each column in an SFrame is a size-immutable SArray, but SFrames\nare mutable in that columns can be added and subtracted with ease. An\nSFrame essentially acts as an ordered dict of SArrays.Currently, we support constructing an SFrame from the following data\nformats: .csv (comma separated value) file, SFrame directory archive (A\ndirectory where an Sframe was saved previously), general text file (with\ncsv parsing options; see read_csv()), Python dictionary,\npandas.DataFrame and JSON.An SFrame can be constructed with data from your local file system, a\nnetwork file system mounted locally, HDFS, Amazon S3, or HTTP(S).See Working with data for more guidance on\ndata structures and the API\ndocs\nfor a more complete reference.ModelsTuri Create offers a broad set of packaged application based toolkits as\nwell as algorithms for model creation.Start with the task you want to accomplishApplication-oriented toolkits in Turi Create offer default parameters, building\nblocks and baseline models that help you get started quickly with their\ndataset without sacrificing the ability to go back and customize models\nlater. Each incorporates automatic feature engineering and model\nselection.Using these toolkits, you can tackle a number of common scenarios:Recommender systems\n\nImage classification\n\nDrawing classification\n\nSound classification\n\nImage similarity\n\nObject detection\n\nStyle transfer\n\nActivity classifier\n\nText classifier\n\nMachine learning essentialsEssential machine learning models, organized into algorithm-based\ntoolkits:Classifiers\n\nRegression\n\nGraph analytics\n\nClustering\n\nNearest Neighbors\n\nTopic models\n\nRefer to the Machine Learning API\ndocumentation\nfor complete algorithms and toolkits.Deployment to Core MLWith Core ML, you can integrate machine learning models into your macOS,\niOS, watchOS, and tvOS app. Many models created  in Turi Create can be\nexported for use in Core ML."},"sframe/":{"url":"sframe/","title":"Working with data","keywords":"","body":"Working with DataPrior to model creation, one has to often parse, clean, and manipulate\ndata to make it ready.

We will use some preprocessed data from\nthe\nMillion Song Dataset to\naid our SFrame-related examples.1  The first table contains metadata\nabout each song in the database.  Here's how we load it into an SFrame:import turicreate as tc\nsongs = tc.SFrame.read_csv(\"millionsong/song_data.csv\")\nNo options are needed for the simplest case, as the SFrame parser infers\ncolumn types. Of course, there are many options you may need to specify\nwhen importing a csv file.  Some of the more common options come in to\nplay when we load the usage data of users listening to these songs\nonline:usage_data = tc.SFrame.read_csv(\"millionsong/10000.txt\",\n                                header=False,\n                                delimiter='\\t',\n                                column_type_hints={'X3':int})\nThe header and delimiter options are needed because this particular\ncsv file does not provide column names in its first line, and the values\nare separated by tabs, not commas.  The column_type_hints keeps the\nSFrame csv parser from attempting to infer the datatype of each column,\nwhich it does by default.  For a full list of options when parsing csv\nfiles, check our API\nReference.Once done we can inspect the first few rows of the tables we've\nimported:songs\nColumns:\n    song_id    str\n    title    str\n    release    str\n    artist_name    str\n    year    int\n\nRows: 1000000\n\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n|      song_id       |             title              |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n| SOQMMHC12AB0180CB8 |          Silent Night          |\n| SOVFVAK12A8C1350D9 |          Tanssi vaan           |\n| SOGTUKN12AB017F4F1 |       No One Could Ever        |\n| SOBNYVR12A8C13558C |      Si Vos Quer\\xc3\\xa9s      |\n| SOHSBXH12A8C13B0DF |        Tantce Of Aspens        |\n| SOZVAPQ12A8C13B63C | Symphony No. 1 G minor \"Si ... |\n| SOQVRHI12A6D4FB2D7 |        We Have Got Love        |\n| SOEYRFT12AB018936C |       2 Da Beat Ch'yall        |\n| SOPMIYT12A6D4F851E |            Goodbye             |\n| SOJCFMH12A8C13B0C2 |   Mama_ mama can't you see ?   |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+\n|            release             |          artist_name           | year |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+\n|     Monster Ballads X-Mas      |        Faster Pussy cat        | 2003 |\n|       Karkuteill\\xc3\\xa4       |        Karkkiautomaatti        | 1995 |\n|             Butter             |         Hudson Mohawke         | 2006 |\n|            De Culo             |          Yerba Brava           | 2003 |\n| Rene Ablaze Presents Winte ... |           Der Mystic           |  0   |\n| Berwald: Symphonies Nos. 1 ... |        David Montgomery        |  0   |\n|   Strictly The Best Vol. 34    |       Sasha / Turbulence       |  0   |\n|            Da Bomb             |           Kris Kross           | 1993 |\n|           Danny Boy            |          Joseph Locke          |  0   |\n| March to cadence with the  ... | The Sun Harbor's Chorus-Do ... |  0   |\n|              ...               |              ...               | ...  |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+\n[1000000 rows x 5 columns]\nNote: Only the head of the SFrame is printed.\nYou can use print_rows(num_rows=m, num_columns=n) to print more rows and columns.\nusage_data\nColumns:\n    X1    str\n    X2    str\n    X3    int\n\nRows: 2000000\n\n+--------------------------------+--------------------+-----+\n|               X1               |         X2         |  X3 |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------+-----+\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SOAKIMP12A8C130995 |  1  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SOBBMDR12A8C13253B |  2  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SOBXHDL12A81C204C0 |  1  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SOBYHAJ12A6701BF1D |  1  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SODACBL12A8C13C273 |  1  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SODDNQT12A6D4F5F7E |  5  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SODXRTY12AB0180F3B |  1  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SOFGUAY12AB017B0A8 |  1  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SOFRQTD12A81C233C0 |  1  |\n| b80344d063b5ccb3212f76538f ... | SOHQWYZ12A6D4FA701 |  1  |\n|              ...               |        ...         | ... |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------+-----+\n[2000000 rows x 3 columns]\nNote: Only the head of the SFrame is printed.\nYou can use print_rows(num_rows=m, num_columns=n) to print more rows and columns.\nHere we might want to rename columns from the default names:usage_data.rename({'X1':'user_id', 'X2':'song_id', 'X3':'listen_count'})\nSFrames can be saved as a csv file or in the SFrame binary format.  If\nyour SFrame is saved in binary format loading it is instantaneous, so we\nwon't ever have to parse that file again.

Suppose we want to change those to a missing value, so\nthat they do not skew a summary statistic over the column (e.g. mean\nor min). If we knew about this before parsing, or are willing to parse\nthe file again, we could add 0 to the na_values option of read_csv.\nAlternatively, we can apply an arbitrary function to one or multiple\ncolumns of an SFrame.

This\nis because the content of the SFrame's columns (a separate data\nstructure called an\nSArray) \nis immutable.  SFrames can add and subtract columns liberally though, as\nit essentially is just a carrier of references to SArrays.We used a lambda function here because it is the simplest way to\ninstantiate a small function like that.  The apply method will take a\nnamed function (a normal Python function that starts with def) as\nwell.  As long as the function takes one parameter and returns one\nvalue, it can be applied to a column.We can also apply a function to multiple columns.  Suppose we want to\nadd a column of the number of times the word 'love' is used in the\ntitle and artist column:songs['love_count'] = songs[['title', 'artist_name']].apply(\n    lambda row: sum(x.lower().split(' ').count('love') for x in row.values()))\nsongs.topk('love_count', k=5)\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n|      song_id       |             title              |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n| SOMYDCX12A8AE4836B | The Love Story (Part 1) In ... |\n| SONXAVM12AB017AA1D |          Document 15           |\n| SOAWJOC12A8C1367A7 |       Black Black Window       |\n| SOXAVWF12A8AE4922C |           One Piece            |\n| SOAJRDR12A8C1383B1 |         Love Love Love         |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+------------+\n|            release             |          artist_name           | year | love_count |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+------------+\n|      Skid Row / 34 Hours       |            Skid Row            | None |     4      |\n| Feels_ Feathers_ Bog and Bees  | Low Low Low La La La Love  ... | None |     3      |\n|          Ends Of June          | Low Low Low La La La Love  ... | 2007 |     3      |\n| Low Low Low La La La Love  ... | Low Low Low La La La Love  ... | 2007 |     3      |\n|           Radio Hitz           |       Spider Murphy Gang       | None |     3      |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+------+------------+\n[5 rows x 6 columns]\nA few things to note here.  We first select a subset of columns\nusing a list within square brackets.  This is useful in general, but it helps us\nwith performance in this case, as fewer values are scanned.  Also, when apply is\ncalled on an SFrame instead of an SArray as shown here, the input of the lambda\nfunction is a dictionary where the keys are the column names, and the values\ncorrespond to that row's values.Another very useful and common operation is the ability to select\ncolumns based on types.  For instance, this extracts all the columns\ncontaining strings.songs[str]\nData:\n+--------------------+-------------------------------+\n|      song_id       |             title             |\n+--------------------+-------------------------------+\n| SOQMMHC12AB0180CB8 |          Silent Night         |\n| SOVFVAK12A8C1350D9 |          Tanssi vaan          |\n| SOGTUKN12AB017F4F1 |       No One Could Ever       |\n| SOBNYVR12A8C13558C |         Si Vos Querés         |\n| SOHSBXH12A8C13B0DF |        Tantce Of Aspens       |\n| SOZVAPQ12A8C13B63C | Symphony No. 1 G minor \"Si... |\n| SOQVRHI12A6D4FB2D7 |        We Have Got Love       |\n| SOEYRFT12AB018936C |       2 Da Beat Ch'yall       |\n| SOPMIYT12A6D4F851E |            Goodbye            |\n| SOJCFMH12A8C13B0C2 |   Mama_ mama can't you see ?  |\n+--------------------+-------------------------------+\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+\n|            release            |          artist_name          |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+\n|     Monster Ballads X-Mas     |        Faster Pussy cat       |\n|          Karkuteillä          |        Karkkiautomaatti       |\n|             Butter            |         Hudson Mohawke        |\n|            De Culo            |          Yerba Brava          |\n| Rene Ablaze Presents Winte... |           Der Mystic          |\n| Berwald: Symphonies Nos. 1... |        David Montgomery       |\n|   Strictly The Best Vol. 34   |       Sasha / Turbulence      |\n|            Da Bomb            |           Kris Kross          |\n|           Danny Boy           |          Joseph Locke         |\n| March to cadence with the ... | The Sun Harbor's Chorus-Do... |\n+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+\nNow, you may not feel comfortable transforming a column without inspecting more\nthan the first 10 rows of it, as we did with the year column.

This basic filter operation\nlooks like this:dated_songs = songs[songs['year'] != None]\ndated_songs\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n|      song_id       |             title              |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n| SOQMMHC12AB0180CB8 |          Silent Night          |\n| SOVFVAK12A8C1350D9 |          Tanssi vaan           |\n| SOGTUKN12AB017F4F1 |       No One Could Ever        |\n| SOBNYVR12A8C13558C |      Si Vos Quer\\xc3\\xa9s      |\n| SOEYRFT12AB018936C |       2 Da Beat Ch'yall        |\n| SOYGNWH12AB018191E |         L'antarctique          |\n| SOLJTLX12AB01890ED |       El hijo del pueblo       |\n| SOMPVQB12A8C1379BB |             Pilots             |\n| SOSDCFG12AB0184647 |              006               |\n| SOBARPM12A8C133DFF | (Looking For) The Heart Of ... |\n+--------------------+--------------------------------+\n+--------------------------------+------------------+------+------------+\n|            release             |   artist_name    | year | love_count |\n+--------------------------------+------------------+------+------------+\n|     Monster Ballads X-Mas      | Faster Pussy cat | 2003 |     0      |\n|       Karkuteill\\xc3\\xa4       | Karkkiautomaatti | 1995 |     0      |\n|             Butter             |  Hudson Mohawke  | 2006 |     0      |\n|            De Culo             |   Yerba Brava    | 2003 |     0      |\n|            Da Bomb             |    Kris Kross    | 1993 |     0      |\n|   Des cobras des tarentules    | 3 Gars Su'l Sofa | 2007 |     0      |\n| 32 Grandes \\xc3\\x89xitos  CD 2 |  Jorge Negrete   | 1997 |     0      |\n|           The Loyal            |    Tiger Lou     | 2005 |     0      |\n|       Lena 20 \\xc3\\x85r        | Lena Philipsson  | 1998 |     0      |\n|           Cover Girl           |   Shawn Colvin   | 1994 |     0      |\n+--------------------------------+------------------+------+------------+\n[? rows x 6 columns]\nNote: Only the head of the SFrame is printed. This SFrame is lazily evaluated.\nYou can use len(sf) to force materialization.\nThe output does a good job at explaining what is happening here.  SFrames will\nnot do any work if it isn't required right away.  This way, if you decide this\nfilter operation isn't for you after looking at the first few rows, Turi\nCreate won't waste computation time doing it anyways.  However, it\nis important to verify that the missing values were indeed removed, and that we\nindeed removed 484424 rows, so we'll force materialization of the new SFrame.len(dated_songs)\n515576\nWhy does this filtering syntax work?  What we're actually doing is placing an\nSArray in the square brackets.  A comparison operator applied to an SArray\nreturns a new SArray of the same length as the original, but with values that\ncorrespond to true or false based on the operator.  Here's what it looks\nlike:songs['year'] != None\ndtype: int\nRows: 1000000\n[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, ... ]\nWe may want to use more than one comparison operator, for which you must place\neach comparison statement in parentheses and use the bitwise boolean logic\noperators to combine the statements, as Python does not allow the overloading of\nlogical operators.  Perhaps we are building a music recommender with this data,\nand we would like to only use \"reasonable\" play counts, for some definition of\nreasonable:reasonable_usage = usage_data[(usage_data['listen_count'] >= 10) & (usage_data['listen_count'] \n114026\nYou can also write a lambda function to filter using the filter function,\nwhich you can read about in the API Reference.Joins and AggregationAnother important way to filter a dataset is to get rid of duplicate\ndata.  A nice way to search for duplicate data is to visualize the\nSFrame.songs.show()\nIt appears our song_id is not completely unique.  This would make merging the\nsongs and usage_data SFrames error-prone if all we want to do is add song\ntitle information to the existing usage data.  In this particular dataset, these\nrepeat songs are included because they may have been released on several\ndifferent albums (movie soundtracks, radio singles, etc.).  If we do not care\nabout which album release is included in the dataset, we can filter those\nduplicates like this:other_cols = songs.column_names()\nother_cols.remove('song_id')\nagg_list = [tc.aggregate.SELECT_ONE(i) for i in other_cols]\nunique_songs = songs.groupby('song_id', dict(zip(other_cols, agg_list)))\nThis code block needs some further explanation.  It is centered around calling\ngroupby with the SELECT_ONE aggregator.  This selects a random\nrepresentative row from each group.  You must explicitly denote which columns\nwill use this aggregator, so the list comprehension gathers all other columns\nthan the one we are grouping by and uses the SELECT_ONE aggregator for each\none.  When used like this, SELECT_ONE will use the same random row for each\ncolumn.  This is great if it is not important which of the duplicates you pick.\nIf it is, another aggregator like MIN or MAX may be in order.Suppose we actually want to see the songs that have the highest play count?  Now\nwe can correctly group each song and aggregate its listen count, and then join\nthe result to the song metadata to see the song titles.usage_groups = usage_data.groupby(['song_id'], {'total_listens': tc.aggregate.SUM('listen_count'),\n                                       'num_unique_users': tc.aggregate.COUNT('user_id')})\nusage_groups.join(songs, ['song_id']).topk('total_listens')\n+--------------------+------------------+---------------+\n|      song_id       | num_unique_users | total_listens |\n+--------------------+------------------+---------------+\n| SOBONKR12A58A7A7E0 |       6412       |     54136     |\n| SOAUWYT12A81C206F1 |       7032       |     49253     |\n| SOSXLTC12AF72A7F54 |       6145       |     41418     |\n| SOEGIYH12A6D4FC0E3 |       5385       |     31153     |\n| SOFRQTD12A81C233C0 |       8277       |     31036     |\n| SOAXGDH12A8C13F8A1 |       6949       |     26663     |\n| SONYKOW12AB01849C9 |       5841       |     22100     |\n| SOPUCYA12A8C13A694 |       3526       |     21019     |\n| SOUFTBI12AB0183F65 |       2887       |     19645     |\n| SOVDSJC12A58A7A271 |       2866       |     18309     |\n+--------------------+------------------+---------------+\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n|             title              |            release             |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n|         You're The One         |       If There Was A Way       |\n|              Undo              |        Vespertine Live         |\n|            Revelry             |       Only By The Night        |\n| Horn Concerto No. 4 in E f ... | Mozart - Eine kleine Nacht ... |\n|         Sehr kosmisch          |       Musik von Harmonia       |\n| Dog Days Are Over (Radio Edit) | Now That's What I Call Mus ... |\n|            Secrets             |           Waking Up            |\n|             Canada             |        The End Is Here         |\n|            Invalid             |         Fermi Paradox          |\n|        Ain't Misbehavin        |           Summertime           |\n+--------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n+--------------------------------+------+------------+\n|          artist_name           | year | love_count |\n+--------------------------------+------+------------+\n|         Dwight Yoakam          | 1990 |     0      |\n|          Bj\\xc3\\xb6rk          | 2001 |     0      |\n|         Kings Of Leon          | 2008 |     0      |\n| Barry Tuckwell/Academy of  ... | None |     0      |\n|            Harmonia            | None |     0      |\n|     Florence + The Machine     | None |     0      |\n|          OneRepublic           | 2009 |     0      |\n|        Five Iron Frenzy        | None |     0      |\n|            Tub Ring            | 2002 |     0      |\n|           Sam Cooke            | None |     0      |\n+--------------------------------+------+------------+\n[10 rows x 8 columns]\nThe usage_data table is already in a great format for feeding to a\nrecommender algorithm as it has user and song identifiers, and some form\nof a metric (number of listens) to rate how much the user liked the\nsong.  The problem here is that users that listened to a song a lot\nwould skew the recommendations.  At some point, once a user plays a song\nenough times, you know they really like it.

Using the connection object in\nthe previous example, here is how you would read the data as an SFrame\nusing the\nfrom_sql\nmethod:import turicreate as tc\nstocks_sf = tc.SFrame.from_sql(conn, \"SELECT * FROM stocks\")\nIf you would like to then write this table to the database, that's easy\ntoo, using the\nto_sql\nmethod. to_sql simply attempts to append to an already existing table,\nso if you intend to write the data to a new table in your database, then\nyou must use the \"CREATE TABLE\" syntax, including the type syntax\nsupported by your database. Here's an example of creating a new table\nand then appending more data to the table.import datetime as dt\nc = conn.cursor()\n\nc.execute('''CREATE TABLE more_stocks\n             (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')\nc.commit()\nstocks_sf.to_sql(conn, \"more_stocks\")\n\n# Append another row\nanother_row = tc.SFrame({'date':[dt.datetime(2006, 3, 28)],\n                         'trans':['BUY'],\n                         'symbol':['IBM'],\n                         'qty':[1000],\n                         'price':[45.00]})\nanother_row.to_sql(conn, \"more_stocks\")\nThat is all there is to know to get started using SFrames with Python DBAPI2\nmodules! For more details you can consult the API documentation of\nfrom_sql\nand\nto_sql.\nCurrently, we have tested our DBAPI2 support with these modules:MySQLdb\n\npsycopg2\n\nsqlite3\n\nThis means that our DBAPI2 support may or may not work on other modules\nclaiming to be DBAPI2-compliant. If you run into errors, let us know by\nfiling a github issue."},"sgraph/sgraph.html":{"url":"sgraph/sgraph.html","title":"Graph data","keywords":"","body":"Working with GraphsGraphs allow us to understand complex networks by focusing on\nrelationships between pairs of items. Each item is represented by a\nvertex in the graph, and relationships between items are represented\nby edges.To facilitate graph-oriented data analysis, Turi Create offers a\nSGraph\nobject, a scalable graph data structure backed by SFrames.  In this\nchapter, we show that SGraphs allow arbitrary dictionary attributes on\nvertices and edges, flexible vertex and edge query functions, and\nseamless transformation to and from SFrames.Creating an SGraphThere are several ways to create an SGraph. The simplest is to start\nwith an empty graph, then add vertices and edges in the form of lists of\nturicreate.Vertex and turicreate.Edge objects. SGraphs are structurally\nimmutable; in the following snippet, add_vertices and add_edges both\nreturn a new graph.from turicreate import SGraph, Vertex, Edge\ng = SGraph()\nverts = [Vertex(0, attr={'breed': 'labrador'}),\n         Vertex(1, attr={'breed': 'labrador'}),\n         Vertex(2, attr={'breed': 'vizsla'})]\ng = g.add_vertices(verts)\ng = g.add_edges(Edge(1, 2))\nprint g\nSGraph({'num_edges': 1, 'num_vertices': 3})\nVertex Fields:['__id', 'breed']\nEdge Fields:['__src_id', '__dst_id']\nWe can chain these steps together to make a new graph in a single line.g = SGraph().add_vertices([Vertex(i) for i in range(10)]).add_edges(\n    [Edge(i, i+1) for i in range(9)])\nSGraphs can also be created from an edge list stored in an SFrame. Vertices are\nadded to the graph automatically based on the edge list, and columns of the\nSFrame not used as source or destination vertex IDs are assumed to be edge\nattributes. Suppose we import a dataset of James Bond characters to\nan SFrame, then build the graph.from turicreate import SFrame\nedge_data = SFrame.read_csv('bond_edges.csv')\n\ng = SGraph()\ng = g.add_edges(edge_data, src_field='src', dst_field='dst')\nprint(g)\nSGraph({'num_edges': 20, 'num_vertices': 10})\nThe SGraph constructor also accepts vertex and edge SFrames directly. We can\nconstruct the same James Bond graph with the following two lines:vertex_data = SFrame.read_csv('bond_vertices.csv')\n\ng = SGraph(vertices=vertex_data, edges=edge_data, vid_field='name',\n           src_field='src', dst_field='dst')\nFinally, an SGraph can be created directly from a file, either local or\nremote, using the\nturicreate.load_sgraph()\nmethod. Loading a graph with this method works with both the native\nbinary save format and a variety of text formats. In the following\nexample we save the SGraph in binary format to a new folder called\n\"james_bond\", then re-load it under a different name.g.save('james_bond.sgraph')\nnew_graph = turicreate.load_sgraph('james_bond.sgraph')\nInspecting SGraphsGraphs can be explored with SGraph.summary---which prints the number of\nvertices and edges---or by retrieving and plotting subsets of edges and\nvertices.print(g.summary())\n{'num_edges': 20, 'num_vertices': 10}\nTo retrieve the contents of an SGraph, the get_vertices and get_edges\nmethods return SFrames. These functions can filter edges and vertices based on\nvertex IDs or attributes. Omitting IDs and attributes returns all vertices or\nedges.sub_verts = g.get_vertices(ids=['James Bond'])\nprint(sub_verts)\n+------------+--------+-----------------+---------+\n|    __id    | gender | license_to_kill | villain |\n+------------+--------+-----------------+---------+\n| James Bond |   M    |        1        |    0    |\n+------------+--------+-----------------+---------+\n[1 rows x 4 columns]\nsub_edges = g.get_edges(fields={'relation': 'worksfor'})\nprint(sub_edges)\n+---------------+-------------+----------+\n|    __src_id   |   __dst_id  | relation |\n+---------------+-------------+----------+\n|       M       |  Moneypenny | worksfor |\n|       M       |  James Bond | worksfor |\n|       M       |      Q      | worksfor |\n| Elliot Carver | Henry Gupta | worksfor |\n| Elliot Carver |  Gotz Otto  | worksfor |\n+---------------+-------------+----------+\n[5 rows x 3 columns]\nThe\nget_neighborhood\nmethod provides a convenient way to retrieve the subset of a graph near\na set of target vertices, also known as the egocentric neighborhood of\nthe target vertices. The radius of the neighborhood is the maximum\nlength of a path between any of the targets and a neighborhood vertex.\nIf full_subgraph is true, then edges between neighborhood vertices are\nincluded even if the edges are not on direct paths between a target and\na neighbor.targets = ['James Bond', 'Moneypenny']\nsubgraph = g.get_neighborhood(ids=targets, radius=1, full_subgraph=True)\nprint(subgraph)\nSGraph({'num_edges': 15, 'num_vertices': 8})\nModifying SGraphsSGraphs are structurally immutable, but the data stored on vertices and edges\ncan be mutated using two special SGraph properties. SGraph.vertices and\nSGraph.edges are SFrames containing the vertex and edge data, respectively.\nThe following examples show the difference between the special graph-related\nSFrames and normal SFrames. First, note that the following lines both produce\nthe same effect.g.edges.print_rows(5)\ng.get_edges().print_rows(5)\n+----------------+----------------+------------+\n|    __src_id    |    __dst_id    |  relation  |\n+----------------+----------------+------------+\n|   Moneypenny   |       M        | managed_by |\n| Inga Bergstorm |   James Bond   |   friend   |\n|   Moneypenny   |       Q        | colleague  |\n|  Henry Gupta   | Elliot Carver  | killed_by  |\n|   James Bond   | Inga Bergstorm |   friend   |\n+----------------+----------------+------------+\n[5 rows x 3 columns]\nThe difference is that the return value of g.get_edges() is a normal SFrame\nindependent from g, whereas g.edges is bound to g. We can modify the edge\ndata using this special edge SFrame. The next snippet mutates the relation\nattribute on the edges of g. In particular, it extracts the first letter and\nconverts it to upper case.g.edges['relation'] = g.edges['relation'].apply(lambda x: x[0].upper())\ng.get_edges().print_rows(5)\n+----------------+----------------+----------+\n|    __src_id    |    __dst_id    | relation |\n+----------------+----------------+----------+\n|   Moneypenny   |       M        |    M     |\n| Inga Bergstorm |   James Bond   |    F     |\n|   Moneypenny   |       Q        |    C     |\n|  Henry Gupta   | Elliot Carver  |    K     |\n|   James Bond   | Inga Bergstorm |    F     |\n|      ...       |      ...       |   ...    |\n+----------------+----------------+----------+\n[20 rows x 3 columns]\nOn the other hand, the following code does not mutate the relation attribute on\nthe edges of g. If it had a permanent effect, the relation field would be\nconverted a lower case letter, but in the result it clearly remains upper case.e = g.get_edges()  # e is a normal SFrame independent of g.\ne['relation'] = e['relation'].apply(lambda x: x[0].lower())\ng.get_edges().print_rows(5)\n+----------------+----------------+----------+\n|    __src_id    |    __dst_id    | relation |\n+----------------+----------------+----------+\n|   Moneypenny   |       M        |    M     |\n| Inga Bergstorm |   James Bond   |    F     |\n|   Moneypenny   |       Q        |    C     |\n|  Henry Gupta   | Elliot Carver  |    K     |\n|   James Bond   | Inga Bergstorm |    F     |\n|      ...       |      ...       |   ...    |\n+----------------+----------------+----------+\n[20 rows x 3 columns]\nCalling a method like head(), tail(), or append() on a special\ngraph-related SFrame also results in a new instance of a regular SFrame. For\nexample, the following code does not mutate g.e = g.edges.head(5)\ne['is_friend'] = e['relation'].apply(lambda x: x[0] == 'F')\nAnother important difference of these two special SFrames is that the __id,\n__src_id, and __dst_id fields are not mutable because changing them would\nchange the structure of the graph and SGraph is structurally immutable.Otherwise, g.vertices and g.edges act like normal SFrames, which makes\nmodifying graph data very easy. For example, adding (removing) an edge\nfield is the same as adding (removing) a column to (from) an SFrame:g.edges['weight'] = 1.0\ndel g.edges['weight']\nThe\ntriple_apply\nmethod provides a particularly powerful way to modify SGraph\nvertex and edge attributes. triple_apply applies a user-defined function to\nall edges asynchronously, allowing you to do a computation that modifies edge\ndata based on vertex data, or vice versa. A wide range of\nmethods---single-source shortest\npath and weighted\nPageRank, for example---can be expressed\nvery simply with this primitive.The first step is to define a function that takes as input an edge in the graph,\ntogether with the incident source and destination vertices. This triple apply\nfunction modifies vertex and edge fields in some way, then returns the modified\n(source vertex, edge, destination vertex) triple. In this example, we compute\nthe degree of each vertex in the James Bond graph, which is the number of\nedges that touch each vertex.def increment_degree(src, edge, dst):\n    src['degree'] += 1\n    dst['degree'] += 1\n    return (src, edge, dst)\nThe next step is to create a new field in our SGraph's vertex data to hold the\nanswer.g.vertices['degree'] = 0\nFinally, we use the triple_apply method to apply the function to all of the\nedges (together with their incident source and destination vertices). This\nmethod requires specification of which fields are allowed to be changed by the\nour function.g = g.triple_apply(increment_degree, mutated_fields=['degree'])\nprint g.vertices.sort('degree', ascending=False)\n+----------------+--------+--------+-----------------+---------+\n|      __id      | degree | gender | license_to_kill | villain |\n+----------------+--------+--------+-----------------+---------+\n|   James Bond   |   8    |   M    |        1        |    0    |\n| Elliot Carver  |   7    |   M    |        0        |    1    |\n|       M        |   6    |   M    |        1        |    0    |\n|   Moneypenny   |   4    |   F    |        1        |    0    |\n|       Q        |   4    |   M    |        1        |    0    |\n|  Paris Carver  |   3    |   F    |        0        |    1    |\n| Inga Bergstorm |   2    |   F    |        0        |    0    |\n|  Henry Gupta   |   2    |   M    |        0        |    1    |\n|    Wai Lin     |   2    |   F    |        1        |    0    |\n|   Gotz Otto    |   2    |   M    |        0        |    1    |\n+----------------+--------+--------+-----------------+---------+\n[10 rows x 5 columns]\nJames Bond is quite the popular guy!To learn more, check out the graph analytics toolkits, the\nAPI Reference\nfor SGraphs."},"text/analysis.html":{"url":"text/analysis.html","title":"Text data","keywords":"","body":"Text AnalysisSuppose our text data is currently arranged into a single file, where\neach line of that file contains all of the text in a single document.\nHere we can use\nSFrame.read_csv\nto parse the text data into a one-column SFrame.import turicreate\nsf = turicreate.SFrame('wikipedia_data')\nColumns:\nX1      str\n\nRows: 72269\n\nData:\n+--------------------------------+\n|               X1               |\n+--------------------------------+\n| alainconnes alain connes i ... |\n| americannationalstandardsi ... |\n| alberteinstein near the be ... |\n| austriangerman as german i ... |\n| arsenic arsenic is a metal ... |\n| alps the alps alpen alpi a ... |\n| alexiscarrel born in saint ... |\n| adelaide adelaide is a coa ... |\n| artist an artist is a pers ... |\n| abdominalsurgery the three ... |\n|              ...               |\n+--------------------------------+\n[72269 rows x 1 columns]\nNote: Only the head of the SFrame is printed.\nText cleaningFirst, we must convert our SFrame of str into an SFrame of type dict using turicreate.text_analytics.count_words.

Turi Create\nprovides one- and two-dimensional plotting capability, as well as an\ninteractive way to explore the contents of a data structure.Turi Create data structures can also be used with other visualization libraries\nlike matplotlib. You can use any Turi Create data\nstructure with matplotlib and other libraries by converting to a Python list,\nPandas DataFrame, Pandas Series, and/or numpy array, depending on what the\nlibrary expects. In this section we'll focus on the built in visualization\nmethods in Turi Create, which are purpose-built for the types of data\nvisualization commonly used in machine learning tasks, and support very large\ndatasets through streaming aggregation.Visualization MethodsThere are three primary visualization methods in Turi Create:show produces a plot summarizing the data structure; the specific plot\nrendered is determined automatically by the type of data structure, the\nunderlying type of the data structure (dtype), and the number of rows of\ndata. See\nSFrame.show\nand\nSArray.show.\n\nturicreate.show(x=, y=) produces a two-dimensional plot of an\nSArray on the X axis, and an SArray on the Y axis. The specific plot rendered\nis determined automatically by the underlying dtype of both x and y.\nSee\nturicreate.show.\n\nexplore opens an interactive view of the data structure. For SFrame and\nSArray, this takes the form of a scrollable table of rows and columns of\ndata. See\nSFrame.explore\nand\nSArray.explore.\n\nTuri Create also enables you to create independent plots including \nscatter plots, \nheatmaps, \ncategorical heatmaps, \nhistograms, \ncolumnwise summaries, and \nitem frequency plots.ShowThe show method displays a plot of the requested data structure or pair of\ndata structures to the user, with an automatically selected plot type. When in\nJupyter Notebook, it outputs to the notebook by default, and otherwise opens a\nnative window. This behavior can be controlled with\nturicreate.visualization.set_target.Streaming CapabilityVisualizations produced by show mostly involve aggregated data. Some examples\nof aggregation used in Turi Create visualization include\nhistogram binning, used in the\nhistogram and heat map plots, and\ncount distinct, used in\nthe summary statistics in SFrame.show. These aggregations can take a long\ntime to perform on a large dataset.To enable you to see the plot immediately, Turi Create runs these aggregators\nin a streaming fashion, operating on small batches of data and updating the\nplot when each batch is complete. This helps you make decisions about what to\ndo next, by giving you an immediate (but partial) view of the dataset, rather\nthan waiting until the aggregation is complete.While aggregation is happening, a green progress bar is shown at the top of the\nplot area (see screenshot below). The progress bar will disappear once\naggregation has finished.One-Dimensional PlotsThe show method on SArray produces a summary of the data in the SArray. For\nnumeric data (int or float), this shows a numeric\nhistogram of the data.\nFor categorical data (str), this shows a\nbar chart\nrepresenting the counts of frequently occurring items, sorted by count. The\nshow method on SFrame produces a summary of each column of the SFrame, using\nthe plot types described for SArray.show.Two-Dimensional PlotsIn addition to the show method available on individual data structures, the\nturicreate.show method takes two parameters (x and y) to plot two data\nstructures, one on each dimension. The x and y parameters must both be\nSArrays of the same length. The specific plot type shown depends on the\nunderlying dtype of x and y as follows:If both x and y are numeric, and larger than 5,000 rows, a numeric\n  heat map is shown.\n\nIf x and y are numeric, and smaller than or equal to 5,000 rows, a\n  scatter plot is shown.\n\nIf one is numeric and the other is categorical, a\nbox plot is shown.\n\nIf both are categorical, a categorical (discrete) heat map is shown.\n\nApproximationIn order to stream plots on very large datasets, we use some highly accurate\napproximate aggregators from\nSketch:Num. Unique in SFrame.show uses num_unique.\n\nMedian in SFrame.show and SArray.show for int and float columns uses quantile.\n\nCounts shown in the plot for categorical item frequency in SFrame.show and SArray.show on str columns use frequent_items.\n\nAll numeric values in Box Plots use quantile.\n\nAll other values shown in Turi Create visualizations are calculated exactly.Plot Customization through the APIMost show methods have optional parameters for specifying some plot\nconfigurations:title= sets the title of the plot for SArray.show and turicreate.show,\nor the title of the exploration UI for SFrame.explore and SArray.explore.\n\nxlabel= sets the label of the X axis for SArray.show and turicreate.show.\n\nylabel= sets the label of the Y axis for SArray.show and turicreate.show.\n\nThese customizations are especially useful when arranging several visualization\nwindows side-by-side for comparison.Saving PlotsVisualizations produced with show allow you to save the rendered plot image\n(Save... produces a .png file) or\nVega specification\n(Save Vega... produces a .json file). An image representation will allow\nyou to share, publish, or view the rendered plot, while the Vega specification\nallows for customization of the rendered plot using a variety of tools that\nsupport Vega specifications, like the\nonline editor.\nYou can find these options in the File menu as shown below:Turi Create also lets you save plots as PNG, SVG, or JSON as part of the \nPython Plot API. You can save a Plot object by invoking the save method, as \nshown in the example below:import turicreate as tc\n# build the plot\nx = tc.SArray([1,2,3,4,5])\ny = x * 2\ncustom_plot = tc.visualization.scatter(x,y)\n# save the plot\ncustom_plot.save(\"custom.json\")\ncustom_plot.save(\"custom.png\")\ncustom_plot.save(\"custom.svg\")\nExploreThe explore method allows for interactive exploration of the dataset,\nincluding raw (non-aggregated) data. This takes the form of a\nscrollable table capable of showing all rows and columns from the dataset:Unlike show, the result of explore cannot be saved to .png or exported as\na Vega specification.See alsoTo see examples of all the possible visualizations you can get from Turi\nCreate, see the gallery.

One commonly used\ncode formatting tool is\nclang-format. Since we don't\nyet have a set of configuration options for the repository, we'll need to make\none.  We don't exactly know the right set of options up front, but we have\nrepresentative example data available in the form of the existing source code.\nWe can use machine learning to help solve this problem. The modeling problem\nthis chapter focuses on is to find the best fitting configuration of\nclang-format, given the existing source code of Turi Create.There are many possible configuration options, with many possible values, and\ntesting all of them would take a very long time. However, we can use a small\nrandom sample of these configurations to model the ideal configuration, by\ntreating each clang-format configuration variable (like\nAlignAfterOpenBracket) as an independent feature to a model. While exploring\nhow to model the formatting of the source code, we will see how visualizing raw\ndata, data aggregated across a single dimension, and data aggregated across two\ndimensions can help us manipulate data and understand the behavior of a model.Loading and exploring dataWe'll start by loading the dataset and getting an overview of the data. There\nare two useful methods on SFrame objects that can help us understand what we\njust loaded:explore gives us a table view of rows and columns of raw data.\n\nshow gives us an aggregated overview of each column in the dataset.\n\nsf = turicreate.SFrame.read_csv('https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/turicreate/datasets/tc-clang-format-results.csv')\nsf.explore()\nThe explore method opens a scrollable table of the raw data from sf arranged\nin rows and columns. This dataset contains the following columns:Lines Added represents the number of lines that would be added, for this\nsource file, for this clang-format configuration.  Lines Removed represents\nthe number of lines that would be removed, per source file, for this\nconfiguration.\n\nFile Path is the path to a file in the Turi Create source tree.\n\nEach column starting with Config. is a distinct clang-format configuration\noption. For example, Config.BasedOnStyle refers to the BasedOnStyle\noption in the\nclang-format options.\nThere are 20 such columns.\n\nEach line in this dataset is created by performing the following steps:From the set of possible file paths under src/unity, sample a random file\npath. This becomes the File Path column.\n\nFrom the set of possible\nclang-format options,\nsample a random combination of options. This becomes each of the 20\nConfig. columns. Note that there are more than 20 clang-format\nconfiguration options available; to speed up this process, we are looking\nonly at the first 20 options in alphabetical order.\n\nApply the set of options in step (2) to the file path in step (1), by running:clang-format -i $FILE_PATH\nThe result of this command is not directly used in the dataset.\nDetermine the diff (in lines added and removed) resulting from step 3 by running:git diff --numstat\nThe result of this command becomes the Lines Added and Lines Removed\ncolumns.\nRevert the changes on disk using git reset --hard, and repeat for another\nrow of data.\nBy having a quick look at the summarized data presented by the show method,\nwe can get a good sense if these columns are ready to be used as targets for\nour model.  Typical problems in the data such as missing values, outliers and\nskewed input values could be easily spotted, allowing us to quickly identify\nthe required cleaning steps.sf.show()\nWe can clearly see that in almost all of the config changes, only a few lines\nof code were changed.  In fact, so few lines of code have changed, that almost\nthe entire distribution is stacked near 0 in the first bin. This suggests\noutliers are skewing the distribution,\nso let's see what they are:sf[sf['Lines Added'] > 10000].explore()\nFrom this subset of the data, we can tell that the files with a large (outlier)\nnumber of lines added tend to come from toolkits/coreml_export/MLModel. Aha!\nIt turns out the MLModel directory is for exporting models in the Core ML model\nformat, and contains a large amount of generated code. Let's exclude it from\nour analysis.mostly_generated_code = sf['File Path'].apply(lambda path: '/MLModel/' in path)\nsf = sf[mostly_generated_code != 1]\nsf.show()\nNow we can have a proper look at the number of changes. It seems that most\ncases only had a few lines changed. From here it looks to go down\nexponentially, with only a few of the configurations leading to more than 500\nlines changed, and almost none with more than 800 changes. By scrolling down in\nthe visualization window, we can also see the distributions of the other\ncolumns:Explore some featuresThe target of our model would be to optimize the number of lines changed,\nregardless of whether they were deleted or added. Let's choose one config\nparameter, and inspect how it correlates with our target of lines changed.  To\nachieve this, we will use the turicreate.show method, that takes two columns\n(SArrays) and plots one on each axis. The type of plot chosen by\nturicreate.show is automatic, based on the underlying data types in each\nSArray, and in this case we're going to get a box\nplot because we are plotting a\ncategorical column with a numeric column.sf['Lines Changed'] = sf['Lines Added'] + sf['Lines Removed']\nturicreate.show(sf['Config.BasedOnStyle'],\n                sf['Lines Changed'],\n                xlabel='Based on Style',\n                ylabel='Lines Changed')\nThe box plot shows us the distribution of values on the Y axis (\"Lines\nChanged\"), for each distinct categorical value on the X axis (\"Based on\nStyle\").  This type of plot shows a line representing the full range of the\ndata (from min to max), and a smaller rectangle within that line that\nrepresents the range of the 2nd and 3rd quartiles (from 25% to 75%).  We can\nsee from this plot that the base style that gives the smallest change overall\nin this sample data is either \"Google\" or \"Chromium\". It appears that in all of\nthe base styles, the majority of the files had only a few line changed, but\nthere were a few files in which thousands of lines have changed. Looking at\nnumber of lines changed might be misleading, as long files would have more\nchanges even if the change itself wasn't significant. We should probably\nnormalize the \"Lines Changed\" measurement by file size. Now that we've noticed\nthis by visualizing this feature, let's go back and adjust in our dataset for\nthe length of the file.file_sizes = turicreate.SFrame.read_csv('https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/turicreate/datasets/tc-clang-format-file-sizes.csv')\nsf = sf.join(file_sizes, on='File Path', how='left')\nsf['Normalized Lines Changed'] = sf['Lines Changed'] / sf['Lines in File']\nturicreate.show(sf['Config.BasedOnStyle'],\n                sf['Normalized Lines Changed'],\n                xlabel='Based on Style',\n                ylabel='Normalized Lines Changed')\nNow we see a much better distribution of lines changed per base config. Now\nthat we've normalized by file size, let's take a look at the distribution of\nlines changed across all configs once more, by calling the show method on the\n\"Normalized Lines Changed\" column:sf['Normalized Lines Changed'].show(title='Normalized Lines Changed')\nAfter eliminating outliers and normalizing for file size, the distribution of\nlines changed starts to make more sense. Now we are ready to create a model.Evaluate a modelNext, let's create a regression model using the data we have now, treating each\n\"Config.\" column as a feature of the model, and the \"Normalized Lines Changed\"\ncolumn as the target to predict. Once the model has been created, we can use it\nto predict the normalized lines changed for a subset of the data. By plotting\nthat prediction against the actual normalized lines changed, we can then get a\nvisual feel for how well the model is performing.(train, test) = sf.random_split(0.9)\nfeatures = [c for c in sf.column_names() if c.startswith('Config.')]\nmodel = turicreate.regression.create(train,\n                                     target='Normalized Lines Changed',\n                                     features=features)\ntest['Predicted Change'] = model.predict(test)\nturicreate.show(test['Normalized Lines Changed'],\n                test['Predicted Change'],\n                xlabel='Actual Change',\n                ylabel='Predicted Change')\nThere doesn't seem to be much correlation between the predicted and actual\nchanges; otherwise, all the points would seem to be close to a straight line,\nand not just scattered about. It seems we'll need to go back and improve our\nmodel. Perhaps more data will help, as the ~6,800 samples we ended up training\non is only a tiny fraction of the possible search space of configuration\nvalues. We also only used a small fraction of the possible configuration\nvariables here, as more would require an even larger sample size.We can see from this exercise that visualization provides a powerful way to\nhelp us visually inspect our data, clean it up, prepare it for modeling, and\nevaluate the quality of a model.

For this example, we use the MovieLens\n20M dataset.1import turicreate as tc\nactions = tc.SFrame.read_csv('./dataset/ml-20m/ratings.csv')\n+--------+---------+--------+------------+\n| userId | movieId | rating | timestamp  |\n+--------+---------+--------+------------+\n|   1    |    2    |  3.5   | 1112486027 |\n|   1    |    29   |  3.5   | 1112484676 |\n|   1    |    32   |  3.5   | 1112484819 |\n|   1    |    47   |  3.5   | 1112484727 |\n|   1    |    50   |  3.5   | 1112484580 |\n|   1    |   112   |  3.5   | 1094785740 |\n|   1    |   151   |  4.0   | 1094785734 |\n|   1    |   223   |  4.0   | 1112485573 |\n|   1    |   253   |  4.0   | 1112484940 |\n|   1    |   260   |  4.0   | 1112484826 |\n+--------+---------+--------+------------+\nFor information on how to load data into an SFrame from other sources,\nsee the chapter on SFrames.You may have additional data about users or items.

In this\ncase, providing the user and item interaction data at model creation\ntime is optional.Creating a modelThere are a variety of machine learning techniques that can be used to\nbuild a recommender model.  Turi Create provides a method\nturicreate.recommender.create that will automatically choose an\nappropriate model for your data set.First we create a random split of the data to produce a validation set\nthat can be used to evaluate the model.training_data, validation_data = tc.recommender.util.random_split_by_user(actions, 'userId', 'movieId')\nmodel = tc.recommender.create(training_data, 'userId', 'movieId')\nNow that you have a model, you can make recommendationsresults = model.recommend()\nLearn moreThe following sections provide more information about the recommender model:Using modelsMaking recommendations\n\nFinding similar items\n\nSaving and loading models\n\n\nChoosing a modelData you might encounter (implicit or explicit)\n\nTypes of models worth considering (item-based similarity, factorization-based models, and so on).\n\n\nDeployment to Core MLExport to Core ML, drag and drop in an iOS application\n\n\nAPI Docs\n"},"recommender/using-trained-models.html":{"url":"recommender/using-trained-models.html","title":"Using models","keywords":"","body":"Using modelsAll recommender objects in the\nturicreate.recommender\nmodule expose a common set of methods, such as\nrecommend\nand\nevaluate.In this section we will coverMaking recommendations\n\nFinding similar items\n\nSaving and loading\n\nMaking recommendationsOnce a model is created, you can now make recommendations of new items\nfor users.  To do so, call model.recommend() with an SArray of user\nids.  If users is set to None, then model.recommend() will make\nrecommendations for all the users seen during model creation, automatically\nexcluding the items that are observed for each user.  In other words, if\ndata contains a row \"Alice, The Great Gatsby\", then\nmodel.recommend() will not recommend \"The Great Gatsby\" for user\n\"Alice\".  It will return at most k new items for each user, sorted by\ntheir rank.  It will return fewer than k items if there are not enough\nitems that the user has not already rated or seen.The score column of the output contains the unnormalized\nprediction scores for each user-item pair.  The semantic meanings of\nthese scores may differ between models.  For the linear regression\nmodel, for instance, a higher average score for a user means that the\nmodel thinks that this user is generally more enthusiastic than\nothers.There are a number of ways to make recommendations: for known users or\nnew users, with new observation data or side information, and with\ndifferent ways to explicitly control item inclusion or exclusion.  Let's\nwalk through these options together.Making recommendations for all usersBy default, calling m.recommend() without any arguments returns the\ntop 10 recommendations for all users seen during model creation.  It\nautomatically excludes items that were seen during model creation. Hence\nall generated recommendations are for items that the user has not\nalready seen.data = turicreate.SFrame({'user_id': [\"Ann\", \"Ann\", \"Ann\", \"Brian\", \"Brian\", \"Brian\"],\n                          'item_id': [\"Item1\", \"Item2\", \"Item4\", \"Item2\", \"Item3\", \"Item5\"],\n                          'rating': [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 2]})\nm = turicreate.factorization_recommender.create(data, target='rating')\n\nrecommendations = m.recommend()\nMaking recommendations for specific usersIf you specify a list or SArray of users, recommend() returns\nrecommendations for only those user(s). The user names must correspond\nto strings in the user_id column in the training data.recommendations = m.recommend(users=['Brian'])\nMaking recommendations for specific users and itemsIn situations where you build a model for all of your users and items,\nyou may wish to limit the recommendations for particular users based on\nknown item attributes. For example, for US-based customers you may want\nto limit recommendations to US-based products. The following code sample\nrestricts recommendations to a subset of users and items -- specifically\nthose users and items whose value in the 'country' column is equal to\n\"United States\".country = 'United States'\nm.recommend(users=users['user_id'][users['country']==country].unique(),\n            items=items['item_id'][items['country']==country])\nMaking recommendations for new usersThis is known as the \"cold-start\" problem.  The recommend() function\nworks seamlessly with new users. If the model has never seen the user,\nthen it defaults to recommending popular items:m.recommend(['Charlie'])\nHere 'Charlie' is a new user that does not appear in the training data.\nAlso note that you don't need to explicitly write down users=; Python\nautomatically assumes that arguments are provided in order, so the first\nunnamed argument to recommend() is taken to be the user list.Incorporating information about a new userTo improve recommendations for new users, it helps to have side\ninformation or new observation data for the user.Incorporating new side informationTo incorporate side information, you must have already created a\nrecommender model that knows how to incorporate side features.  This can\nbe done by passing in side information to create().  For example:user_info = turicreate.SFrame({'user_id': ['Ann', 'Brian'],\n                                'age_category': ['2', '3']})\nm_side_info = turicreate.factorization_recommender.create(data, target='rating',\n                                                             user_data=user_info)\nNow, we can add side information for the new user at recommendation\ntime. The new side information must contain a column with the same name\nas the column in the training data that's designated as the 'user_id'.\n(For more details, please see the API documentation for\nturicreate.recommender.create.)new_user_info = turicreate.SFrame({'user_id' : ['Charlie'],\n                                 'age_category' : ['2']})\nrecommendations = m_side_info.recommend(['Charlie'],\n                                        new_user_data = new_user_info)\nGiven Charlie's age category, the model can incorporate what it knows about the importance of age categories for item recommendations.  Currently, the following models can take side information into account when making recommendations: LinearRegressionModel, FactorizationRecommender.  LinearRegressionModel is the simpler model, and FactorizationRecommender the more powerful.  For more details on how each model makes use of side information, please refer to the model definition sections in the individual models' API documentation.Incorporating new observation datarecommend() accepts new observation data. Currently, the ItemSimilarityModel makes the best use of this information.m_item_sim = turicreate.item_similarity_recommender.create(data)\nnew_obs_data = turicreate.SFrame({'user_id' : ['Charlie', 'Charlie'],\n                                'item_id' : ['Item1', 'Item5']})\nrecommendations = m_item_sim.recommend(['Charlie'], new_observation_data = new_obs_data)\nControlling the number of recommendationsThe input parameter k controls how many items to recommend for each user.recommendations = m.recommend(k = 5)\nExcluding specific items from recommendationSuppose you make some recommendations to the user and they ignored them.\nSo now you want other recommendations.  This can be done by explicitly\nexcluding those undesirable items via the exclude keyword argument.exclude_pairs = turicreate.SFrame({'user_id' : ['Ann'],\n                                    'item_id' : ['Item3']})\n\nrecommendations = m.recommend(['Ann'], k = 5, exclude = exclude_pairs)\nBy default, recommend() excludes items seen during training, so that\nit would not recommend items that the user has already seen.  To change\nthis behavior, you can specify exclude_known=False.recommendations = m.recommend(exclude_known = False)\nIncluding specific items in recommendationSuppose you want to see only recommendations within a subset of items.\nThis can be done via the items keyword argument.  The input must be an\nSArray of items.item_subset = turicreate.SArray([\"Item3\", \"Item5\", \"Item2\"])\nrecommendations = m.recommend(['Ann'], items = item_subset)\nFinding Similar ItemsMany of the above models make recommendations based on some notion of\nsimilarity between a pair of items. Querying for similar items can help\nyou understand the model's behavior on your data.We have made this process very easy with the\nget_similar_items\nfunction:similar_items = model.get_similar_items(my_list_of_items, k=20)\nThe above will return an SFrame containing the 20 nearest items for\nevery item in my_list_of_items. The definition of \"nearest\" depends on\nthe type of similarity used by the model. For instance, \"jaccard\"\nsimilarity measures the two item's overlapping users. The 'score' column\ncontains a similarity score ranging between 0 and 1, where larger values\nindicate increasing similarity. The mathematical formula used for each\ntype of similarity can be found in the API documentation for\nItemSimilarityRecommender.For a factorization-based model, the similarity used for is the\nEuclidean distance between the items' two factors, which can be obtained\nusing m['coefficients'].Saving and loading modelsThe model can be saved for later use, either on the local machine or in\nan AWS S3 bucket. The saved model sits in its own directory, and can be\nloaded back in later to make more predictions.model.save(\"my_model.model\")\nLike other models in Turi Create, we can load the model back:model = tc.load_model(\"my_model.model\")\n"},"recommender/choosing-a-model.html":{"url":"recommender/choosing-a-model.html","title":"Choosing a model","keywords":"","body":"Choosing a ModelIn this section, we give some intuition for which modeling choices you\nmay make depending on your data and your task. Each recommender model in\nTuri Create has certain strengths that fit well with certain types of\ndata and different objectives.The easiest way to choose a model is to let Turi Create choose your\nmodel for you.  This is done by simply using the default\nrecommender.create function, which chooses the model based on the data\nprovided to it.  As an example, the following code creates a basic item\nsimilarity model and then generates recommendations for each user in the\ndataset:m = turicreate.recommender.create(data, user_id='user', item_id='movie')\nrecs = m.recommend()\nUsing the default create method provides an excellent way to quickly get\na recommender model up and running, but in many cases it's desirable to\nhave more control over the process.Effectively choosing and tuning a recommender model is best done in two\nstages.  The first stage is to match the type of data up with the\ncorrect model or models, and the second stage is to correctly evaluate\nand tune the model(s) and assess their accuracy.  Sometimes one model\nworks better and sometimes another, depending on the data set. In a\nlater section, we'll look at evaluating a model so you can be confident\nyou chose the best one.Data Type: Explicit, Implicit, or Item Content Data?With Explicit data, there is an associated target column that gives a\nscore for each interaction between a users and an items.  An example of\nthis type would be a data set of user's ratings for movies or books.\nWith this type of data, the objective is typically to either predict\nwhich new items a user would rate highly or to predict a user's rating\non a given item.Implicit data does not include any rating information.  In this case,\na dataset may have just two columns -- user ID and item ID.  For this\ntype of data, the recommendations are based on which items are similar\nto the items a user has interacted with.The third type of data that Turi Create can use to build a recommender\nsystem is item content data.  In this case, information associated\nwith each individual item, instead of the user interaction patterns, is\nused to recommend items similar to a collection of items in a query set.\nFor example, item content could be a text description of an item, a set\nof key words, an address, categories, or even a list of similar items\ntaken from another model.Working with Explicit DataIf your data is explicit, i.e., the observations include an actual\nrating given by the user, then the model you wish to use depends on\nwhether you want to predict the rating a user would give a particular\nitem, or if you want the model to recommend items that it believes the\nuser would rate highly.If you have ratings data and care about accurately predicting the rating\na user would give a specific item , then we typically recommend you use\nthe factorization_recommender.  In this model the observed ratings are\nmodeled as a weighted combination of terms, where the weights (along\nwith some of the terms, also known as factors) are learned from data.\nAll of these models can easily incorporate user or item side features.A linear model assumes that the rating is a linear combination of user\nfeatures, item features, user bias, and item popularity bias.  The\nfactorization_recommender goes one step further and allows each rating\nto also depend on a term representing the inner product of two vectors,\none representing the user's affinity to a set of latent preference\nmodes, and one representing the item's affinity to these modes.  These\nare commonly called latent factors and are automatically learned from\nobservation data.  When side data is available, the model allows for\ninteraction terms between these learned latent factors and all the side\nfeatures.  As a rule of  thumb, the presence of side data can make the\nmodel more finicky to learn (due to its power and flexibility).If you care about ranking performance, instead of simply predicting\nthe rating accurately, then choose\nItemSimilarityRecommender\nor\nRankingFactorizationRecommender.\nWith rating data, the item_similarity_recommender model scores items\nbased on how likely they predict the user will rate them highly, but the\nabsolute values of the predicted scores may not match up with the actual\nratings a user would give the item.The\nRankingFactorizationRecommender\ntries to recommend items that are both similar to the items in a user's\ndataset and, if rating information is provided, those that would be\nrated highly by the user.  It tends to predict ratings with less\naccuracy than the non-ranking factorization_recommender, but it tends\nto do much better at choosing items that a user would rate highly.  This\nis because it also penalizes the predicted rating of items that are\nsignificantly different from the items a user has interacted with.  In\nother words, it only predicts a high rating for user-item pairs in which\nit predicts a high rating and is confident in that prediction.Furthermore, this model works particularly well when the target ratings\nare binary, i.e., if they come from thumbs up/thumbs down flags. In this\ncase, use the input parameter binary_targets = True.When a target column is provided, the model returned by the default\nrecommender.create function is a matrix factorization model. The\nmatrix factorization model can also be called directly with\nranking_factorization_recommender.create.\nWhen using the model-specific create function, other arguments can be\nprovided to better tune the model, such as num_factors or\nregularization.  See the documentation on\nRankingFactorizationRecommender\nfor more information.m = turicreate.ranking_factorization_recommender.create(data,\n                                          user_id='user',\n                                    item_id='movie',\n                                    target='rating')\nWorking with Implicit DataThe goal a recommender system built with implicit data is to recommend\nitems that are similar to those similar to the collection of items a\nuser has interacted with.  \"Similar\" in this case is determined by other\nuser interactions -- if most users with similar behavior to a given user\nalso interacted with a item the given user had not, that item would\nlikely in the given user's recommendations.In this case, the default recommender.create function in the example\ncode above code returns an\nItemSimilarityRecommender\nwhich computes the similarity between each pair of items and recommends\nitems to each user that are closest to items they have already used or\nliked:m = turicreate.item_similarity_recommender.create(data,\n                                                user_id='user',\n                                                item_id='movie')\nThe ranking_factorization_recommender is also great for implicit data,\nand can be called the same way:m = turicreate.ranking_factorization_recommender.create(data,\n                                          user_id='user',\n                                    item_id='movie')\nWith implicit data, the ranking factorization model has two solvers, one\nwhich uses a randomized sgd-based method to tune the results, and the\nother which uses an implicit form of alternating least squares (iALS).\nThe default sgd-based method samples unobserved items along with the\nobserved ones, then treats them as negative examples.  This is the\ndefault solver.  Implicit ALS is a version of the popular Alternating\nLeast Squares (ALS) algorithm that attempts to find factors that\ndistinguish between the given user-item pairs and all other negative\nexamples.  This algorithm can be faster than the sgd method,\nparticularly if there are many items, but it does not currently support\nside features.  This solver can be activated by passing in solver =\n\"ials\" to ranking_factorization_recommender.create. On some\ndatasets, one of these solvers can yield better precision-recall scores\nthan the item_similarity_recommender.Item Content DataThe\nItemContentRecommender\nbuilds a model similar to the item similarity model, but uses\nsimilarities between item content to actually build the model.  In\nthis model, the similarity score between two items is calculated by\nfirst computing the similarity between the item data for each column,\nthen taking a weighted average of the per-column similarities to get\nthe final similarity.  The recommendations are generated according to\nthe average similarity of a candidate item to all the items in a\nuser's set of rated items.  This model can be created without\nobservation data about user-item interactions, in which case such\ninformation must be passed in at recommend time in order to make\nrecommendations.Note that in most situations, the similarity patterns of items\ncan be inferred effectively from patterns in the user interaction\ndata, and the factorization_recommender and\nitem_similarity_recommender do this effectively.  However,\nleveraging information about item content can be very useful,\nparticularly when the user-item interaction data is sparse or not\nknown until recommend time.Side information for users, items, and observationsIn many cases, additional information about the users or items can\nimprove the quality of the recommendations.  For example, including\ninformation about the genre and year of a movie can be useful\ninformation in recommending movies.  We call this type of information\nuser side data or item side data depending on whether it goes with the\nuser or the item.Including side data is easy with the user_data or item_data\nparameters to the recommender.create() function.  These arguments\nare SFrames and must have a user or item column that corresponds to\nthe user_id and item_id columns in the observation data.  Internally,\nthe data is joined to the particular user or item when training the\nmodel, the data is saved with the model and also used to make\nrecommendations.In particular, the\nFactorizationRecommender\nand the\nRankingFactorizationRecommender\nboth incorporate the side data into the prediction through additional\ninteraction terms between the user, the item, and the side feature. For\nthe actual formula, see the API docs for the\nFactorizationRecommender.\nBoth of these models also allow you to obtain the parameters that have\nbeen learned for each of the side features via the m['coefficients']\nargument.Side data may also be provided for each observation. For example, it\nmight be useful to have recommendations change based on the time at\nwhich the query is being made. To do so, you could create a model using\nan SFrame that contains a time column, in addition to a user and item\ncolumn. For example, a \"time\" column could include a string indicating\nthe hour; this will be treated as a categorical variable and the model\nwill learn a latent factor for each unique hour.# sf has columns: user_id, item_id, time\nm = tc.ranking_factorization_recommender.create(sf)\nIn order to include this information when requesting observations, you\nmay include the desired additional data as columns in an SFrame for the\nusers argument to m.recommend(). In our example above, when querying\nfor recommendations, you would include the time that you want to use for\neach set of recommendations.users_query = tc.SFrame({'user_id': [1, 2, 3], 'time': ['10pm', '10pm', '11pm']})\nm.recommend(users=user_query)\nIn this case, recommendations for user 1 and 2 would use the parameters\nlearned from observations that occurred at 10pm, whereas the\nrecommendations for user 3 would incorporate parameters corresponding to\n11pm. For more details, check out\nrecommend\nin the API docs.You may check the number of columns used as side information by querying\nm['observation_column_names'], m['user_side_data_column_names'], and\nm['item_side_data_column_names']. By printing the model, you can also\nsee this information. In the following model, we had four columns in the\nobservation data (two of which were user_id and item_id) and four\ncolumns in the SFrame passed to item_side_data (one of which was\nitem_id):Class                           : RankingFactorizationRecommender\n\nSchema\n------\nUser ID                         : user_id\nItem ID                         : item_id\nTarget                          : None\nAdditional observation features : 2\nNumber of user side features    : 0\nNumber of item side features    : 3\nIf new side data exists when recommendations are desired, this can be\npassed in via the new_observation_data, new_user_data, and\nnew_item_data arguments. Any data provided there will take precedence\nover the user and item side data stored with the model.Not all of the models make use of side data: the\npopularity_recommender and item_similarity_recommender create\nmethods currently do not use it.Suggested pre-processing techniquesLastly, here are a couple of common data issues that can affect the\nperformance of a recommender.  First, if the observation data is very\nsparse, i.e., contains only one or two observations for a large number\nof users, then none of the models will perform much better than the\nsimple baselines available via the popularity_recommender.  In this\ncase, it might help to prune out the rare users and rare items and try\nagain.  Also, re-examine the data collection and data cleaning process\nto see if mistakes were made.  Try to get more observation data per user\nand per item, if you can.Another issue often occurs when usage data is treated as ratings.\nUnlike explicit ratings that lie on a nice linear interval, say 0 to 5,\nusage data can be badly skewed.  For instance, in the Million Song\ndataset, one user played a song more than 16,000 times.  All the models\nwould have a difficult time fitting to such a badly skewed target.  The\nfix is to bucketize the usage data.  For instance, any play count\ngreater than 50 can be mapped to the maximum rating of 5.  You can also\nclip the play counts to be binary, e.g., any number greater than 2 is\nmapped to 1, otherwise it's 0.Evaluating Model PerformanceWhen trying out different recommender models, it's critical to have a\nprincipled way of evaluating their performance.  The standard approach\nto this is to split the observation data into two parts, a training\nset and a test set.  The model is trained on the training set, and\nthen evaluated on the test set -- evaluating your model on the same\ndataset that it was trained on gives a very bad idea of how well it\nwill perform in practice.  Once the model type and associated parameters\nare chosen, the model can be trained on the full dataset.With recommender systems, we can evaluate models using two different\nmetrics, RMSE and precision-recall.  RMSE measures how well the model\npredicts the score of the user, while precision-recall measures how\nwell the recommend() function recommends items that the user also\nchooses.  For example, the best RMSE value is when the model exactly\npredicts the value of all the ratings in the test set.  Similarly, the\nbest precision-recall value is when the user has 5 items in the test\nset and recommend() recommends exactly those 5 items.  While both can\nbe important depending on the type of data and desired task,\nprecision-recall is often more useful in evaluating how well a\nrecommender system will perform in practice.The Turi Create recommender toolkit includes a function,\ntc.recommender.random_split_by_user,\nto easily generate training and test sets from observation data.\nUnlike tc.SFrame.random_split, it only puts data for a subset of the\nusers into the test set.  This is typically sufficient for evaluating\nrecommender systems.tc.recommender.random_split_by_user generates a test set by first\nchoosing a subset of the users at random, then choosing a random\nsubset of that user's items.  By default, it chooses 1000 users and,\nfor each of these users, 20% of their items on average.  Note that not\nall users may be represented by the test set, as some users may not\nhave any of their items randomly selected for the test set.Once training and test set are generated, the\ntc.recommender.util.compare_models\nfunction allows easy evaluation of several models using either RMSE or\nprecision-recall.

It seems to be helping make tremendous\nbreakthroughs, but what is it? It's a methodology for learning\nhigh-level concepts about data, frequently through models that have\nmultiple layers of non-linear transformations.  Let's take a moment to\nanalyze that last sentence. Learning high-level concepts about data\nmeans that deep learning models take data, for instance raw pixel values\nof an image, and learn abstract ideas like 'is animal' or 'is cat'\nabout that data.  OK, easy enough, but what does having 'multiple layers\nof non-linear transformations' mean.  Conceptually, all this means is\nthat you have a composition of simple non-linear functions, forming a\ncomplex non-linear function, which can map things as complex as raw\npixel values to image category. This is what allows deep learning models\nto attain such amazing results.The most common class of methods within the computer vision domain are\nConvolutional Neural Nets (CNNs). Typically, the challenge arises in how\nyou have to choose how many layers your network has. And how to\ninitialize the model parameter values (also known as weights).  There’s\na lot more, too.  Basically, a deep learning model is a machine with\nmany confusing knobs (called hyper-parameters, basically parameters that\nare not learned by the algorithm) and dials that will not work if set\nrandomly. Yet, when good hyper-parameter settings come together, results\nare very strong.The key goal of the image classifier toolkit is to reduce the complexity\nin creating a model that is suitable for a wide variety of datasets\n(small or large) with images of various categories.Transfer LearningIt’s not uncommon for the task you want to solve to be related to\nsomething that has already been solved. Take, for example, the task of\ndistinguishing cats from dogs. The famous ImageNet Challenge, for which\nCNN’s are the state-of-the-art, asks the trained model to categorize\ninput into one of 1000 classes. Shouldn't features that distinguish\nbetween categories like lions and wolves also be useful for\ndiscriminating between cats and dogs?The answer is a definitive yes. It is accomplished by simply removing\nthe output layer of the Deep Neural Network for 1000 categories, and\ntaking the signals that would have been propagating to the output layer\nand feeding them as features to a classifier for our new cats vs dogs\ntask.So, when you run the Turi Create image classifier, it breaks things down\ninto something like this:Stage 1: Create a CNN classifier on a large, general dataset. A\ngood example is ImageNet, with 1000 categories and 1.2 million images.\nThe models are already trained by researchers and are available for us\nto use.\nStage 2: The outputs of each layer in the CNN can be viewed as a\nmeaningful vector representation of each image. Extract these feature\nvectors from the layer prior to the output layer on each image of your\ntask.\nStage 3: Create a new classifier with those features as input for\nyour own task.\nAt first glance, this seems even more complicated than just training the\ndeep learning model. However, Stage 1 is reusable for many different\nproblems, and once done, it doesn't have to be changed often.In the end, this pipeline results in not needing to adjust\nhyper-parameters, faster training, and better performance even in cases\nwhere you don't have enough data to create a convention deep learning\nmodel. What's more, this technique is effective even if your Stage 3\nclassification task is relatively unrelated to the task Stage 1 is\ntrained on. This idea was first explored by Donahue et al. (2013), and\nhas since become one of the best ways to create image classifier models.Pretrained Image ClassifiersThe following shows the built-in state-of-the-art network architectures\nfor image classification.

Each point is a dictionary with two keys, \"x\" and \"y\" with numerical values representing the intensity of the stroke. Here is an example of a drawing with two strokes that have five points each:example_drawing = [\n    [\n        {\"x\": 1.0, \"y\": 2.0},\n        {\"x\": 2.0, \"y\": 2.0},\n        {\"x\": 3.0, \"y\": 2.0},\n        {\"x\": 4.0, \"y\": 2.0},\n        {\"x\": 5.0, \"y\": 2.0}\n    ], # end of first stroke\n    [\n        {\"x\": 10.0, \"y\": 10.0},\n        {\"x\": 10.5, \"y\": 10.5},\n        {\"x\": 11.0, \"y\": 11.0},\n        {\"x\": 12.5, \"y\": 12.5},\n        {\"x\": 15.0, \"y\": 15.0}\n    ]\n]\nWhen stroke-based drawing data is given as input to turicreate.drawing_classifier.create, a series of pre-processing steps are applied to convert the stroke-based drawings to bitmaps which is then consumed by the neural network. This data transformation can be visualized through the turicreate.drawing_classifier.util.draw_strokes(...) Python API as well.The data preprocessing to convert stroke-based drawings into 28x28 bitmaps \nis three-fold:Align and Normalize Points: We normalize all the strokes by \nscaling or stretching them so that all the coordinates lie in [0, 255].\nSimplify Normalized Strokes: In this step, we reduce the number of \npoints needed to represent each stroke in an effort to reduce the amount of \ndata we have to deal with during the rasterization step. In most \ndrawing/rendering ecosystems, points are usually sampled at a frequency high \nenough that some key points can capture the drawing that all the points \nrendered. To simplify drawings and get rid of redundant points, we employ the\nRamer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which decimates a stroke composed of \nline segments to a similar curve with fewer points.\nRasterization: Rasterization from the simplified normalized strokes to \nthe final bitmap that the Neural Network can consume, can be further broken \ndown into three steps: \n 1. First, we render the simplified drawing that we \n got as an output from Step 2 as an intermediate bitmap of size 256x256 \n (since all our normalized points lie in [0, 255]). \n 2. Next, we blur the intermediate bitmap.\n 3. Finally, we resize the blurred intermediate bitmap down to a final bitmap\n size of 28x28, which the Neural Network can consume.\nThe function turicreate.drawing_classifier.util.draw_strokes(example_drawing).show() helps visualize the strokes.Warm StartTo boost the accuracy of the models Turi Create users train, and to help those \nmodels converge faster, we provide the option of loading in a pretrained model\nfor a warm start."},"drawing_classifier/data-preparation.html":{"url":"drawing_classifier/data-preparation.html","title":"Data Preparation","keywords":"","body":"Quick, Draw!

For someone without\nsound domain knowledge, this is probably the most complicated part.\nNothing about this stage is updated based on the input data (i.e. nothing\nis learned in this stage).At a high level, the preprocessing pipeline does the following:The raw pulse code modulation data from the wav file is converted to\nfloats on a [-1.0, +1.0] scale.\n\nIf there are two channels, the elements are averaged to produce one channel.\n\nThe data is resampled to only 16,000 samples per second.\n\nThe data is broken up into several overlapping windows.\n\nA Hamming Window is applied to each windows.\n\nThe Power Spectrum is calculated, using a Fast Fourier Transformation.\n\nFrequencies above and below certain thresholds are dropped.\n\nMel Frequency Filter Banks are applied.\n\nFinally the natural logarithm is taken of all values.\n\nThe preprocessing pipeline takes 975ms worth of audio as input (exact\ninput length depends on sample rate) and produces an array of shape\n(96, 64).VGGish Feature Extraction StageVGGish is a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network from Google,\nsee their paper and their GitHub page for more details. As the name suggests, the architecture of\nthis network is inspired by the famous VGG networks used for image\nclassification. The network consists of a series of convolution and\nactivation layers, optionally followed by a max pooling layer.\nThis network contains 17 layers in total.This network is kept static during model training. We have removed the\nlast three layers of the original VGGish model. We use the widest\nlayer, from the original network, as our input data for the final\nstage. This modified VGGish model outputs a double vector of length\n12,288. On non-Linux systems, the model has also been eight bit\nquantized, to reduce its size.Custom Neural Network StageThis is the only stage which is updated based on the input data.\nDuring training of a sound classifier this model is trained using\nthe features from VGGish and the input labels. During prediction,\nonly a forward pass is done using this network. This custom neural\nnetwork is a simple three layer neural network. The first two\nlayers are dense layers, with 100 units each. These layers use RELU activation).\nThe final layer is a softmax.

For example this is required by both K-Folds Cross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning. In such cases much of the work across different runs can be reused.Sound Classification is done using a three stage process. The work done in the first two of these stages (signal preprocessing and VGGish feature extraction) will be identical across runs and can be reused.The code below use the ESC-10 dataset from the Introductory Example to do 5-folds cross validation:import turicreate as tc\n\ndata = tc.load_sframe('./ESC-10')\n\n# Calculate the deep features just once.\ndata['deep_features'] = tc.sound_classifier.get_deep_features(data['audio'])\n\naccuracies = []\nfor cur_fold in data['fold'].unique():\n    test_set = data.filter_by(cur_fold, 'fold')\n    train_set = data.filter_by(cur_fold, 'fold', exclude=True)\n\n    model = tc.sound_classifier.create(train_set,\n                                       target='category',\n                                       feature='deep_features')\n\n    metrics = model.evaluate(test_set)\n    accuracies.append(metrics['accuracy'])\n\nprint(\"Accuracies: {}\".format(accuracies))\nThis allows us to perform 5-fold cross validation more than twice as fast. For larger datasets the time savings will be even greater.Tune Custom Neural Network ConfigurationThe custom neural network used by the Sound Classifier is made up of a series of dense layers. Using more layers or more units in each layer can have a significant affect on accuracy. This will also affect the size of your model.The custom_layer_sizes parameter allows you specify how many layers and the number of units in each layer. The default values for this parameter is [100, 100] which corresponds to two dense layers with a 100 units each.Using a smaller number of overall units will result in a smaller model, potentially with minimal affects on accuracy. If you have a large amount of training data, you should get better accuracy by using more layers and/or more units.The code below tries several different neural network configurations and reports the validation accuracy for each one:import turicreate as tc\n\ndata = tc.load_sframe('./ESC-10')\n\n# Calculate the deep features just once.\ndata['deep_features'] = tc.sound_classifier.get_deep_features(data['audio'])\n\n# Try several different neural network configurations\nmodels = []\nnetwork_configurations = ([100, 100], [100], [1000, 1000], [100, 100, 100])\nfor cur_hyper_parameter in network_configurations:\n    cur_model = tc.sound_classifier.create(data, target='category',\n                                             custom_layer_sizes=cur_hyper_parameter,\n                                             feature='deep_features')\n    models.append(cur_model)\n\n# Report results\nfor m, p in zip(models, network_configurations):\n    print(\"{}, {}\".format(p, m.validation_accuracy))\n"},"sound_classifier/export-coreml.html":{"url":"sound_classifier/export-coreml.html","title":"Deployment to Core ML","keywords":"","body":"Deployment to Core MLNote: This functionality is only available on iOS 12+ and macOS 10.14+The Turi Create Sound Classifier Models are also available for use in\nyour iOS/macOS via exporting to Core ML.

This image or array of images does not need to be a part of the\noriginal dataset.query_results = model.query(reference_data[0:10], k=10)\nquery_results.head()\n+-------------+-----------------+---------------+------+\n| query_label | reference_label |    distance   | rank |\n+-------------+-----------------+---------------+------+\n|      0      |        0        |      0.0      |  1   |\n|      0      |       2557      | 18.3461090355 |  2   |\n|      0      |       7000      | 18.3861360371 |  3   |\n|      0      |       2664      |  18.655464356 |  4   |\n|      0      |       1968      |  18.887705352 |  5   |\n|      0      |       7764      | 19.0063301087 |  6   |\n|      0      |       4296      | 19.0114573751 |  7   |\n|      0      |       221       | 19.1188139256 |  8   |\n|      0      |       1361      | 19.1415785143 |  9   |\n|      0      |       1148      | 19.1690505999 |  10  |\n+-------------+-----------------+---------------+------+\n[100 rows x 4 columns]\nNow, for a simple image like this (let's say the 10th image in the data).reference_data[9]['image'].show()\n\nNote: the loading order of images is non-deterministic, so your 10th image\nis likely something different but this isn't important for demonstration purposes.The 10 most \"similar\" looking images aresimilar_rows = query_results[query_results['query_label'] == 9]['reference_label']\nreference_data.filter_by(similar_rows, 'id').explore()\nSimilarity graphIn some cases, we want to find the most similar images in the reference\ndataset for all images in the reference dataset.

If you have\nmacOS 10.13 or higher, Turi Create will automatically use the GPU.

When you run\nthe Turi Create image classifier, it breaks things down into something\nlike this:Stage 1: Uses a pre-trained CNN classifier on a large, general\ndataset. A good example is ImageNet, with 1000 categories and 1.2\nmillion images.\nStage 2: The outputs of each layer in the CNN can be viewed as a\nmeaningful vector representation of each image. Extract these feature\nvectors from the layer prior to the output layer on each image of your\ntask.\nStage 3: Create a nearest\nneighbors model with those\nfeature vectors as input.\nReferences[1] L.

Given an image, a\ndetector will produce instance predictions that may look something like this:This particular model was instructed to detect instances of animal faces.\nThe notion of localization is here provided by bounding boxes around the\ninstances.Introductory ExampleIn this example, the goal is to predict if there are bikes or cars in a\npicture and where in the picture they are located (Go to Data\nPreparation to find out how to get ig02.sframe).import turicreate as tc\n\n# Load the data\ndata =  tc.SFrame('ig02.sframe')\n\n# Make a train-test split\ntrain_data, test_data = data.random_split(0.8)\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = tc.object_detector.create(train_data)\n\n# Save predictions to an SArray\npredictions = model.predict(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary\nmetrics = model.evaluate(test_data)\n\n# Save the model for later use in Turi Create\nmodel.save('mymodel.model')\n\n# Export for use in Core ML\nmodel.export_coreml('MyCustomObjectDetector.mlmodel')\nData AcquisitionThe introductory example creates a model assuming the data already exists, but before we create our model, \nwe require labeled data. This data should consist of images and ground truth\nannotations (correct class label and bounding box for each instance). The more data we\nhave, the better our predictions will be. Ground truth data should look similar\nto prediction data, at least what you hope it will look like. Here is an example:In this particular example, we chose ball and cup to be object classes. Each\ninstance of these objects therefore gets a ground truth bounding box. In this scenario we are not\ninterested in detecting fruit, so we leave them unmarked. You should decide a\nlist of object classes of interest, preferably in advance. If you start marking\nup all potentially interesting objects in your training images, you may end up with\nclasses with very few samples. Alternatively, you can annotate as much as you\nwant and then pass a list of classes to create using the classes parameter;\nobject instances not covered in this list will simply be ignored.The ground truth annotations for the image above should be encoded as a list\nof dictionaries, each dictionary representing a single bounding box:[{'coordinates': {'height': 104, 'width': 110, 'x': 115, 'y': 216},\n  'label': 'ball'},\n {'coordinates': {'height': 106, 'width': 110, 'x': 188, 'y': 254},\n  'label': 'ball'},\n {'coordinates': {'height': 164, 'width': 131, 'x': 374, 'y': 169},\n  'label': 'cup'}]\nYou may optionally include 'type': 'rectangle' to explicitly denote these as\nbounding boxes. If type is defined as something else, the object detector\nwill ignore that dictionary.  A bounding box is defined by four values (x,\ny, width, height) where (0, 0) is the top left corner. The center of the\nbox is located at (x, y):It is customary for bounding boxes to tightly surround instances. However, this\nis only a convention and it is entirely up to you and your training data to\ndefine how instances should be represented as boxes. If you for instance only need to\npredict the center of objects, feel free to set all widths/heights to a\ntoken value (e.g. 100) in your training data.It is up to you to choose how many bounding boxes you define for each image.\nHowever, try to be consistent with your notion of instances. If you are trying\nto detect persons, then every occurrence of a person should warrant a ground\ntruth bounding box. If you leave some persons unmarked, the model can get\nconfused why some persons are marked as positives (presence of an instance)\nwhile others are marked as negatives (absence of an instance). If you want, you\nmay include images without any bounding boxes whatsoever (pure negatives),\ngranted that no instances appear in those images. This can be an effective way\nof reducing false positives. For instance, if you train a model to detect balls\nand the training set you provide never includes other round objects, you may\nfind that your model starts assigning high confidence of ball to other\nsimilar objects. In the photo above, the presence of an apple and a clementine\nmay actually help to prevent such mistakes, even though they are not marked up\nexplicitly.The lists of bounding boxes should be placed inside an SFrame alongside the\nimages:+------------------------+-------------------------------+\n|         image          |          annotations          |\n+------------------------+-------------------------------+\n| Height: 375 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 204... |\n| Height: 375 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 148... |\n| Height: 334 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 146... |\n| Height: 500 Width: 345 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 321... |\n| Height: 480 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 301... |\n| Height: 375 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 121... |\n| Height: 335 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 119... |\n| Height: 335 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 150... |\n| Height: 500 Width: 333 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 235... |\n| Height: 333 Width: 500 | [{'coordinates': {'y': 120... |\n+------------------------+-------------------------------+\n[1821 rows x 2 columns]\nWhen arranging your data, keep in mind that the model can be quite literal in\nits interpretation of the task. Please keep these following considerations in mind:The data should be varied. Use many photos of your object instances in\ndifferent contexts, from a variety of angles and scales, lighting\nconditions, etc. If you only have photos of your object from the same pose\n(e.g. person facing the camera), then at test time it will likely fail to\nmake a detection if a different pose is presented (e.g. person looking\naway). Unless you specifically want the detector to have such behavior, you\nwill need to vary the pose in your training data. If you use broad categories\nof objects, such as a cup or dog, include a wide variety of types of cups\nand breeds of dogs.\nThe ground truth data should be representative of the actual use case data. For instance,\nif you take photos of a catalog of products only inside a warehouse, it may not\nwork well if your users are making predictions inside a store.\nYou can expect to need at least 30 samples (bounding boxes) per object class,\nbut even that will be too few for many challenging tasks. For high quality\nresults, plan to have closer to 200 samples per class.Once you have arranged your data, it is worth visually checking that the bounding boxes\nmatch your expectations:data['image_with_ground_truth'] = \\\n    tc.object_detector.util.draw_bounding_boxes(data['image'], data['annotations'])\ndata.explore()\nModel CreationOnce the ground truth data is ready, creating the model is easy:model = tc.object_detector.create(data, feature='image', annotations='annotations')\nModel creation may take time. If you do not have access to a GPU, it can take\nas much as a day to train a good model. Progress will be continuously printed to\ngive you a sense of the time it will take. The number of training iterations is\ndetermined automatically based on the size of your dataset. If you want to\nlower this value to make model creation faster, you can change it by manually\npassing max_iterations to create.  This may lead to a model with inferior\nprediction results. To know for sure, we will soon discuss how to do\nquantitative model evaluation. Before that, let us make some predictions on\nimages so far unseen by the model.Making PredictionsIf images is a list of tc.Image instances, we can make predictions:test = tc.SFrame({'image': images})\ntest['predictions'] = model.predict(test)\nThe new column with predictions is in the same format as ground truth\nannotations. The only difference is that the bounding box dictionaries now\ninclude an entry for prediction confidence:[{'confidence': 0.7225357099539148,\n  'coordinates': {'height': 73.92794444010806,\n                  'width': 90.45315889211807,\n                  'x': 262.2198759929745,\n                  'y': 155.496952970812},\n  'label': 'dog',\n  'type': 'rectangle'},\n {'confidence': 0.5670584769557776,\n  'coordinates': {'height': 82.3002741887019,\n                  'width': 96.48565420737631,\n                  'x': 85.07887845066891,\n                  'y': 237.6466784964736},\n  'label': 'dog',\n  'type': 'rectangle'}]\nYou can also use the same function that we used to visualize the ground truth\nannotations to visually inspect our predictions:test['image_with_predictions'] = \\\n    tc.object_detector.util.draw_bounding_boxes(test['image'], test['predictions'])\ntest[['image', 'image_with_predictions']].explore()\nAnother useful way to inspect predictions is to convert them to stacked\nformat, which is an SFrame where each row represents a bounding box (see\nAdvanced Usage).EvaluationIn image classification, an evaluation score of 90% accuracy means we can\nexpect the model to make the correct prediction in 9 out of 10 images. For\nobject detection we report mean average precision (mAP), which is not nearly\nas intuitive. The main take aways of using this metric are:It is a value between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%), with higher being better.\n\nUse the quantitative metric primarily as a relative measure between different\nmodels (training time, sample size, etc.). A single value will not give you\na sense of whether or not the detector is good enough for your use case.\nRely on qualitative prediction examples for that. However, if you train\na new model that improves your mAP metric from 47% to 55%, you know that\nthe new model is stronger without having to look through images and make a\ndifficult judgement call.\n\nWe describe this metric in more detail in the Advanced\nUsage section, where we also cover using Core ML\nto deploy your detector to iOS and macOS.Using GPUsGPUs can make creating an object detection model much faster. If you have\nmacOS 10.14 or higher, Turi Create will automatically use an available discrete\nGPU. (Integrated Intel GPUs are not supported.)

You can do this by splitting your ground truth\ndata:import turicreate as tc\n\ntrain, val = data.random_split(0.8)\nmodel = tc.object_detector.create(train)\nscores = model.evaluate(val)\nprint(scores['mean_average_precision'])\n0.23121281\nNote, if we run the evaluation on train, it will get a significantly higher\nscore and not be representative of how the model will perform on new data.\nLet's discuss how to interpret the score 23.1%.  As we describe how this metric\nis calculated, you will realize why it is hard to get a high score. As a\nresult, you might find that a value of 25% mAP represents a more predictive\nmodel than it may sound.First, we need to define what a correct prediction is.\nYour model will unlikely give a bounding box that corresponds to the ground\ntruth perfectly, so we need a measurement of how close we are. For this,\na score called\nintersection-over-union (IoU) is\nused. It is a value between 0% (no overlap) and 100% (perfect overlap). Here\nare a few examples:For a prediction to be considered correct, it needs to have the correct class\nlabel and an IoU score against the ground truth that is greater than a\npre-determined threshold. As you can see in the examples, if a precise\nlocalization is not critically important, then a threshold of 50% may be suitable. If two\nor more predictions have an IoU greater than the threshold, only one gets\ndesignated as correct (true positive, TP) and the rest as incorrect (false\npositive, FP). Ground truth bounding boxes that were completely ignored by the model are also considered incorrect (false negative, FN).Based on these three types of predictions (TP/FP/FN) we can compute precision\nand recall scores.\nHowever, before we do this, remember that the model also associates each\nprediction with a confidence score between 0% and 100% (remember the prediction\nimage with two dogs).  We use this by considering a confidence threshold and\nrejecting predictions if they fall below it prior to computing TP/FP/FN.\nInstead of setting this threshold manually, we calculate scores for all\npossible thresholds and plot the resulting precision and recall for each\nthreshold value as a curve. The average precision is the area under this\nprecision and recall curve.  This metric is calculated per object class and\naveraged, to compute mean average precision (mAP).Remember that we had to decide an IoU threshold to compute this metric. Setting\nit to 50% is what we call mean_average_precision_50 (popularized by the PASCAL\nVOC dataset). Use this score if precise localization is not\nimportant. However, if precise localization is desirable, then this metric may not\ndifferentiate between a model with sloppy and a model with precise\nlocalization. As a remedy to this, our primary metric averages\nthe mAP over a range of IoU thresholds between 50% to 95% (in increments of 5\npercentage points). We call this simply mean_average_precision (popularized by the\nCOCO dataset). A model that evaluates to 90% mAP at 50% IoU threshold\nmay only get 50% mAP at varied IoU thresholds, so the mean_average_precision metric tends\nto report seemingly low scores even for relatively high quality models.Stacked annotationsPredictions are returned in the same format as ground truth annotations. Each row\nrepresents an image and the bounding boxes are found inside a list. We call this format\nunstacked. It can be useful to inspect annotations (predictions or ground truth)\nin a stacked format, where each row is a single bounding box. We provide functions\nto convert between these two formats:predictions = model.predict(test)\n\npredictions_stacked = tc.object_detector.util.stack_annotations(predictions)\nprint(predictions_stacked)\n+--------+------------+-------+---------+---------+--------+--------+\n| row_id | confidence | label |    x    |    y    | height | width  |\n+--------+------------+-------+---------+---------+--------+--------+\n|   0    |    0.723   |  dog  | 262.220 | 155.497 | 73.928 | 90.453 |\n|   0    |    0.567   |  dog  | 85.079  | 237.647 | 82.300 | 96.486 |\n+--------+------------+-------+---------+---------+--------+--------+\nYou can also convert back to unstacked:unstacked_predictions = tc.object_detector.util.unstack_annotations(\n        predictions_stacked,\n        num_rows=len(test))\nThis gives you the option to arrange ground truth data in stacked format and\nthen convert it to unstacked. The option num_rows is optional and is only\nnecessary if you have true negative images that are not represented in the\nstacked format. The returned SArray unstacked_predictions will be identical\nto predictions."},"object_detection/export-coreml.html":{"url":"object_detection/export-coreml.html","title":"Deployment to Core ML","keywords":"","body":"Deploying to Core MLObject detector models created in Turi Create can easily be deployed to\nCore ML.Deployment for iOS 12 and macOS 10.14 (Turi Create 5)With Turi Create 5.0+ and starting in iOS 12, macOS 10.14 you can\ndirectly integrate object detector models via the Vision\nFrameworkYou can export to Core ML in Turi Create 5 as follows:model.export_coreml('MyDetector.mlmodel')\nlet mlmodel = MyDetector()\nlet visionModel = try VNCoreMLModel(for: mlmodel.model)\nlet objectRecognition = VNCoreMLRequest(model: visionModel,\n                                        completionHandler: { (request, error) in\n    guard let results = request.results else { return }\n\n    for case let foundObject as VNRecognizedObjectObservation in results {\n        let bestLabel = foundObject.labels.first! // Label with highest confidence\n        let objectBounds = foundObject.boundingBox\n\n        // Use the computed values.\n        print(bestLabel.identifier, bestLabel.confidence, objectBounds)\n    }\n})\nobjectRecognition.imageCropAndScaleOption = .scaleFill\nFor more details on the integration with Core ML and a sample app to get\nyou started, please look at the the article on\nRecognizing Objects in Live Capture.Note: Only models that were exported with non-maximum suppression (the default\nbehavior in Turi Create 5.0+) will work with this example app. Older models\nor models that specify include_non_maximum_suppression=False will not give\nresults as VNRecognizedObjectObservation objects and instead as\nVNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation objects; these are silently ignored in\nthis example app. To learn how to work with VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation\nobjects, please continue reading.Deployment for iOS 11 and  macOS 10.13To deploy the object detector in apps for iOS 11 and macOS 10.13, you\nneed a few extra steps (these have been incorporated into iOS 12 and\nmacOS 10.14).You can export to Core ML in Turi Create 5 as follows:model.export_coreml('MyDetector.mlmodel', include_non_maximum_suppression=False)\nand with Turi Create 4 you can domodel.export_coreml('MyDetector.mlmodel')\nThis Core ML model takes an image and outputs two matrices of floating\npoint values, confidence and coordinates. The first one has shape\nN-by-C, where N is the maximum number of bounding boxes that can be\nreturned in a single image, and C is the number of classes. If you index\nthis at (n, c), you get the confidence of the n:th bounding box for\nclass c. The other output, coordinates, is N-by-4 and contains [x,\ny, width, height] coordinates for each bounding box. The\ncoordinates are expressed relative to the original input size as values\nbetween 0 and 1. This is because it does not know the size before it was\nresized to fit the neural network. To get pixel values as in Turi\nCreate, you have to multiply x and width by the original width y\nand height by the original height. Note that x and y refer to the\ncenter of the box.Drag and drop MyDetector.mlmodel into your Xcode project and add it to\nyour app by ticking the appropriate Target Membership check box.

The meta data\nalso contains a third type of threshold that we have yet to discuss:\nnon_maximum_suppression_threshold:let nmsThreshold = Float(userDefined[\"non_maximum_suppression_threshold\"]!) ?? 0.5\nBefore we discuss how to use this threshold, we must first make a prediction.PredictionMaking a prediction is easy:let model = try VNCoreMLModel(for: mlmodel.model)\n\nlet request = VNCoreMLRequest(model: model, completionHandler: { [weak self] request, error in\n    self?.processClassifications(for: request, error: error)\n})\nrequest.imageCropAndScaleOption = .scaleFill\nWe use .scaleFill that stretches the image into the native input size of the\nmodel. If you use .centerCrop or .scaleFit, it will be a bit tricker to\ncorrectly map the bonding box coordinate system to the original input image.From the request results we get two MLMultiArray instances,\ncoordinates and confidence. For easier handling, we will convert these\nresults into an array of the following struct:struct Prediction {\n    let labelIndex: Int\n    let confidence: Float\n    let boundingBox: CGRect\n}\nWhile building an array of these, we might as well trim the list of predictions\nby enforcing a minimum confidence threshold. This threshold is entirely up to\nyou and your user experience and corresponds to the confidence_threshold\nparameter in predict inside Turi Create:let results = request.results as!

This array contains more predictions than returned by\npredict in Turi Create, since we are still missing a post-processing step\ncalled non-maximum suppression.Non-maximum suppressionThis step is performed automatically by predict in Turi Create, but it\nis not performed inside the Core ML inference model, so we will have to\nadd it ourselves. The model is prone to predict multiple similar\npredictions associated with a single object instance. Here are the\nresults of the two dogs without non-maximum suppression:The algorithm is simple: Start by taking your highest-confidence prediction and\nadd it to your final list of predictions.\nCheck the IoU (see Evaluation) between it and and all the remaining\npredictions. Remove (or suppress) any prediction with an IoU above a\npre-determined threshold (the nmsThreshold we extracted from the meta data).\nRepeat this procedure, now excluding predictions that you have already added\nor removed. Here is a reference implementation:# Array to store final predictions (after post-processing)\nvar predictions: [Prediction] = []\nlet orderedPredictions = unorderedPredictions.sorted { $0.confidence > $1.confidence }\nvar keep = [Bool](repeating: true, count: orderedPredictions.count)\nfor i in 0.. nms_threshold {\n                    keep[j] = false\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe intersection-over-union can be computed as:public func IoU(_ a: CGRect, _ b: CGRect) -> Float {\n    let intersection = a.intersection(b)\n    let union = a.union(b)\n    return Float((intersection.width * intersection.height) / (union.width * union.height))\n}\nThe array predictions is now the final array of predictions corresponding\nto what predict returns in Turi Create."},"object_detection/how-it-works.html":{"url":"object_detection/how-it-works.html","title":"How it works","keywords":"","body":"How it worksFor a long time, object detection models used to separate mechanisms to\nperform localization (where) and classification (what). These models\nare called two-stage detectors and still yield competitive results. However,\nrecent work has combined these two steps into a single deep learning model,\nmaking them one-stage detectors:\"You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection\" by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, Ali Farhadi (CVPR 2016) \n\n\"SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector\" by Wei Liu, Dragomir Anguelov, Dumitru Erhan, Christian Szegedy, Scott Reed, Cheng-Yang Fu, Alexander C. Berg (ECCV 2016)\n\n\"YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger\" by Joseph Redmon, Ali Farhadi (CVPR 2017)\n\nThese models are incredibly fast and can run at impressive frame rates even on\nmobile devices like an iPhone. The overall model is similar to an image\nclassifier (see How it works). The main\ndifference is that the network is instructed to predict the presence of multiple objects\nper image, each object instance associated with a bounding box localization. In fact, our model predicts a fixed set of 2535 instances. The exact\nnumber comes from 13x13x15, where 13-by-13 describes a fixed grid of center\nlocations. The last number represents a pre-defined list of 15 canonical\nbounding box shapes (e.g. 32-by-32 and 256-by-128). Since most images have only\na handful of object instances, the vast majority of the 2535 instances are eliminated\neither by having low confidence or by the non-maximum suppression algorithm\n(see Advanced Usage). The list of locations and shapes is\nmeant to provide anchor boxes that should roughly cover the prediction needs\nof any image. In other words, given an image of an object, at least one of the\n2535 anchor boxes should be reasonably close to the correct bounding box for\nthat object. However, a perfect match will be rare. To address this,\nadjustment values for both location and shape are also predicted and used to\ntweak the fixed anchor boxes to yield more precise localization.Transfer LearningDuring training, similar to the image classifier, we employ Transfer\nLearning. In fact,\nour starting point is still an image classifier trained on 1000 classes. This\nmeans that the network has seen millions of images before it even looked at any\nof our data. This is great, because it reduces the data annotation burden on\nus and is exactly what allows us to create reasonable detectors sometimes with\nonly 30 samples per class in our training data. However, since the starting\nnetwork was not primed for detection, we do need to adapt it for\nthe new task. This requires what is called end-to-end fine-tuning, which is\nthe process of gently updating all the weights (parameters) for the new task,\nwithout forgetting all the useful visual semantics it previously learned.\nContrast this with image classification, where it was enough to adjust the top\nlayer. As a result, model creation time is longer for the object detector\nthan what it is for the image classifier.YOLOThe model that we use is a re-implementation of TinyYOLO (YOLOv2 with a Darknet\nbase network).Source Link: https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet\n\nProject Page: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/\n\nCitation: \"YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger\" by Joseph Redmon, Ali Farhadi (CVPR 2017)\n\nLicense: Multiple (see https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)\n\n"},"style_transfer/":{"url":"style_transfer/","title":"Style transfer","keywords":"","body":"Style TransferStyle Transfer is a task wherein the stylistic elements of a style image\nare imitated onto a new image while preserving the content of the new\nimage.

You can adjust this using the max_size parameter:stylized_images = model.stylize(test_images, max_size=1024)\nIt is not always the case that stylizing your images at the highest\npossible resolution will produce the desired effect on your image so we\nrecommend you choose this based on your styles and the desired effect\nyou'd like it to have.

Such sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, thermostats, and more found in most handheld devices today.Possible applications include counting swimming laps using a watch's accelerometer data, turning on Bluetooth controlled lights when recognizing a certain gesture using gyroscope data from a handheld phone, or creating shortcuts to your favorite phone applications using hand gestures.The activity classifier in Turi Create creates a deep learning model capable of detecting  temporal features in sensor data, lending itself well to the task of activity classification. Before we dive into the model architecture, let's see a working example.Introductory ExampleIn this example we create a model to classify physical activities done by users of a handheld phone, using both accelerometer and gyroscope data. We will use data from the HAPT experiment which contains recording sessions of multiple users, each performing certain physical activities.1 The performed activities are walking, climbing up stairs, climbing down stairs, sitting, standing, and laying.Sensor data can be collected at varying frequencies. In the HAPT dataset, the sensors were sampled at 50Hz each - meaning 50 times per second. However, most applications would want to show outputs to the user at larger intervals. We control the output prediction rate via the prediction_window parameter. For example, if we want to produce a prediction every 5 seconds, and the sensors are sampled at 50Hz - we would set the prediction_window to 250 (5 sec * 50 samples per second).Below is a 3-seconds example of 'walking' data from a single session in the HAPT dataset:In contrast, here is a 3-seconds example of 'sitting' data:The goal of an activity classifier is to distinguish between such samples. Let's see how we can do that with Turi Create. Below is a complete example of loading the HAPT dataset, and creating an activity classifier to distinguish between these examples. The code for getting the data into an SFrame can be found here.import turicreate as tc\n\n# Load sessions from preprocessed data\ndata = tc.SFrame('hapt_data.sframe')\n\n# Train/test split by recording sessions\ntrain, test = tc.activity_classifier.util.random_split_by_session(data, session_id='exp_id', fraction=0.8)\n\n# Create an activity classifier\nmodel = tc.activity_classifier.create(train, session_id='exp_id', target='activity', prediction_window=50)\n\n# Evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary\nmetrics = model.evaluate(test)\nprint(metrics['accuracy'])\n\n# Save the model for later use in Turi Create\nmodel.save('mymodel.model')\n\n# Export for use in Core ML\nmodel.export_coreml('MyActivityClassifier.mlmodel')\nSince we have created the model with samples taken at 50Hz and set the prediction_window to 50, we will get one prediction per second. Invoking our newly created model on the above 3-seconds walking example produces the following per-second predictions:walking_3_sec = data[(data['activity'] == 'walking') & (data['exp_id'] == 1)][1000:1150]\nmodel.predict(walking_3_sec, output_frequency='per_window')\n+---------------+--------+---------+\n| prediction_id | exp_id |  class  |\n+---------------+--------+---------+\n|       0       |   1    | walking |\n|       1       |   1    | walking |\n|       2       |   1    | walking |\n+---------------+--------+---------+\n[3 rows x 3 columns]\nWe've seen how we can quickly create an activity classifier given recorded sessions of sensor data.

The code below assumes the data was unzipped into a directory named HAPT Data Set. This folder contains 3 types of files - a file containing the performed activities for each experiment, files containing the collected accelerometer samples, and files containing the collected gyroscope samples.The first file is labels.txt, which contains activities performed for each experiment. The labels are specified by sample index ranges. For example, in experiment 1 the subject was performing activity number 5 between the 250th collected sample and the 1232th collected sample. The activities are encoded between numbers 1 and 6. We convert these to strings at the end of this section. The code below imports Turi Create, loads labels.txt into an SFrame, and defines a function to find the label given a sample index.import turicreate as tc\n\ndata_dir = './HAPT Data Set/RawData/'\n\ndef find_label_for_containing_interval(intervals, index):\n    containing_interval = intervals[:, 0][(intervals[:, 1] \n+--------+---------+-------------+-------+------+\n| exp_id | user_id | activity_id | start | end  |\n+--------+---------+-------------+-------+------+\n|   1    |    1    |      5      |  250  | 1232 |\n|   1    |    1    |      7      |  1233 | 1392 |\n|   1    |    1    |      4      |  1393 | 2194 |\n|   1    |    1    |      8      |  2195 | 2359 |\n|   1    |    1    |      5      |  2360 | 3374 |\n|   1    |    1    |      11     |  3375 | 3662 |\n|   1    |    1    |      6      |  3663 | 4538 |\n|   1    |    1    |      10     |  4539 | 4735 |\n|   1    |    1    |      4      |  4736 | 5667 |\n|   1    |    1    |      9      |  5668 | 5859 |\n+--------+---------+-------------+-------+------+\n[1214 rows x 5 columns]\nNext, we need to get the accelerometer and gyroscope data for each experiment. For each experiment, every sensor's data is in a separate file. In the code below we load the accelerometer and gyroscope data from all experiments into a single SFrame. While loading the collected samples, we also calculate the label for each sample using our previously defined function. The final SFrame contains a column named exp_id to identify each unique sessions.from glob import glob\n\nacc_files = glob(data_dir + 'acc_*.txt')\ngyro_files = glob(data_dir + 'gyro_*.txt')\n\n# Load data\ndata = tc.SFrame()\nfiles = zip(sorted(acc_files), sorted(gyro_files))\nfor acc_file, gyro_file in files:\n    exp_id = int(acc_file.split('_')[1][-2:])\n\n    # Load accel data\n    sf = tc.SFrame.read_csv(acc_file, delimiter=' ', header=False, verbose=False)\n    sf = sf.rename({'X1': 'acc_x', 'X2': 'acc_y', 'X3': 'acc_z'})\n    sf['exp_id'] = exp_id\n\n    # Load gyro data\n    gyro_sf = tc.SFrame.read_csv(gyro_file, delimiter=' ', header=False, verbose=False)\n    gyro_sf = gyro_sf.rename({'X1': 'gyro_x', 'X2': 'gyro_y', 'X3': 'gyro_z'})\n    sf = sf.add_columns(gyro_sf)\n\n    # Calc labels\n    exp_labels = labels[labels['exp_id'] == exp_id][['activity_id', 'start', 'end']].to_numpy()\n    sf = sf.add_row_number()\n    sf['activity_id'] = sf['id'].apply(lambda x: find_label_for_containing_interval(exp_labels, x))\n    sf = sf.remove_columns(['id'])\n\n    data = data.append(sf)\nFinally, we encode the labels back into a readable string format, and save the resulting SFrame.target_map = {\n    1.: 'walking',          \n    2.: 'climbing_upstairs',\n    3.: 'climbing_downstairs',\n    4.: 'sitting',\n    5.: 'standing',\n    6.: 'laying'\n}\n\n# Use the same labels used in the experiment\ndata = data.filter_by(target_map.keys(), 'activity_id')\ndata['activity'] = data['activity_id'].apply(lambda x: target_map[x])\ndata = data.remove_column('activity_id')\n\ndata.save('hapt_data.sframe')\nTo learn more about the expected input format of the activity classifier please visit the advanced usage section."},"activity_classifier/advanced-usage.html":{"url":"activity_classifier/advanced-usage.html","title":"Advanced Usage","keywords":"","body":"Advanced UsageIn this section, we will cover the input data format for the activity classifier, as well as the different output formats available. For these purposes we will use the HAPT dataset from the previous chapter.Input Data FormatAn activity classifier is created using data from different sensors collected at a certain frequency over a period of time. The activity classifier in Turi Create expects all sensors to be sampled at the same frequency. For example, in the HAPT dataset the sensors sampled were a 3-axial accelerometer, and a 3-axial gyroscope, resulting in 6 values (or features) per timestamp. Both sensors were sampled at 50Hz, i.e. 50 samples were collected per second. The figure below shows 3 seconds of walking data collected from a single subject in the HAPT experiment.The sensor sampling frequency depends on the activities being classified and various practical constraints. For example, if you are trying to detect minuscule motions such as a jerk of a finger you may require high sampling frequency, while a lower one may be required for detecting coarser motions such as swimming. Further considerations are device battery usage and model creation time. A high sampling frequency requires more calls to the different sensors. This results in higher battery drain and larger volumes of data, increasing model complexity and creation time.Commonly, an application using an activity classifier would provide the user with predictions at a slower rate than the sensor sampling rate, depending on the activities. For example, counting steps could require a prediction every second, while for detecting sleep patterns a rate of once per minute is probably sufficient. While creating a model it is important to feed it with labels at the same rate as the desired predictions rate. The number of sensor samples associated with a single label is called the prediction window. The activity classifier uses the prediction window to determine the prediction frequency, i.e. producing a prediction after every prediction_window samples. For the HAPT dataset we use a prediction_window of 50, producing a prediction every second as the sensors were sampled at 50Hz.Each set of consecutive samples produced from a single recording of a subject is called a session. A session can contain demonstrations of multiple activities. However, sessions aren't required to contain all activities or be of the same length. The input data to the activity classifier must contain a column to uniquely assign each sample to a session. The activity classifier in Turi Create expects the samples associated with each session id to be in an ascending order by time. More sessions from more subjects allow the activity classifier to generalize better to new sessions it has not seen before.Below is an example of an input SFrame expected by the activity classifier, taken from the HAPT dataset. The example contains 2 sessions, distinguished by the exp_id column. In this example, the first session contains samples for walking only, while the second session contains samples for standing and sitting.+--------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n| exp_id | activity |  acc_x   |   acc_y   |  acc_z   |   gyro_x  |   gyro_y  |   gyro_z  |\n+--------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n|   1    | walking  | 0.708333 | -0.197222 | 0.095833 | -0.751059 |  0.345444 |  0.038179 |\n|   1    | walking  | 0.756944 | -0.173611 | 0.169444 | -0.545503 |  0.218995 |  0.046426 |\n|   1    | walking  | 0.902778 | -0.169444 | 0.147222 | -0.465785 |  0.440128 | -0.045815 |\n|   1    | walking  | 0.970833 | -0.183333 | 0.118056 | -0.357662 |  0.503964 | -0.206472 |\n|   1    | walking  | 0.972222 | -0.176389 | 0.166667 | -0.312763 |  0.64263  | -0.309709 |\n|   2    | standing | 1.036111 | -0.290278 | 0.130556 |  0.039095 | -0.021075 |  0.034208 |\n|   2    | standing | 1.047222 | -0.252778 |   0.15   |  0.135612 |  0.015272 | -0.045815 |\n|   2    | standing |  1.0375  | -0.209722 | 0.152778 |  0.171042 |  0.009468 | -0.094073 |\n|   2    | standing | 1.026389 |  -0.1875  | 0.148611 |  0.210138 | -0.039706 | -0.094073 |\n|   2    | sitting  | 1.013889 | -0.065278 | 0.127778 | -0.020464 | -0.142332 |  0.091324 |\n|   2    | sitting  | 1.005556 | -0.058333 | 0.127778 | -0.059254 | -0.138972 |  0.055589 |\n|   2    | sitting  |   1.0    | -0.070833 | 0.147222 | -0.058948 | -0.124922 |  0.026878 |\n+--------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n[12 rows x 8 columns]\nIn this example, if prediction_window is set to 2, then every 2 rows within a session will be considered for a single prediction. Less than prediction_window rows at the end of a session also produce a single prediction. A prediction_window of 2 will produce 3 predictions for exp_id 1 and 4 predictions for exp_id 2, while a prediction_window of 5 will produce a single prediction for exp_id 1 and 2 predictions for exp_id 2.Prediction FrequencyRemember the prediction frequency of the activity classifier is determined by the prediction_window parameter. Thus, a prediction is produced for every prediction_window rows in a session. For the above example from the HAPT dataset, setting the prediction window to 50 will produce a single prediction per 50 samples, which corresponds to a prediction per second.model.predict(walking_3_sec, output_frequency='per_window')\n+---------------+--------+---------+\n| prediction_id | exp_id |  class  |\n+---------------+--------+---------+\n|       0       |   1    | walking |\n|       1       |   1    | walking |\n|       2       |   1    | walking |\n+---------------+--------+---------+\n[3 rows x 3 columns]\nHowever, in many machine learning workflows it is common to use predictions from one model as input for further analysis or modeling.

The deep learning model relies on convolutional layers to extract temporal features from a single prediction window, for example an arching movement could possibly be a strong indicator of swimming. Furthermore, it relies on recurrent layers to extract temporal features over time, for example if a subject was swimming in the previous timestamp, then it is most likely not sky diving in the next. Below is a sketch of the neural network used for the activity classifier in Turi Create.A single input to the neural network is a session as defined in the previous section. The convolutional layer operates on each prediction window, finding spatial features that may be relevant to the labeled activities. Returning to our 3-seconds walking session from the previous section, a convolutional layer may determine the following \"spike\" as a feature relevant to walking:The output of the convolutional layer is a vector representation for each prediction window, encoding these learnt features. The recurrent layer takes as input a sequence of these vectors.The recurrent layer is specialized for learning temporal features across sequences. For example it may learn that spatial features associated with walking are more likely to occur after detecting spatial features associated with running. These features are further encoded into the output of the recurrent layer.In order to detect these features along sessions the recurrent layer takes into account its own state - the output of the recurrent layer for the previous prediction window.

For example, when studying reviews about\nmobile phones you may be interested in how people feel about aspects\nsuch as battery life, screen resolution, size, etc.Introductory ExampleLet's now take a look at a simple example of sentiment analysis where\nthe task is to predict whether it contains positive or negative\nsentiment.  For instance, the model will predict \"positive sentiment\"\nfor a snippet of text -- whether it is a movie review or a tweet -- when\nit contains words like \"awesome\" and \"fantastic\". Likewise, having many\nwords with a negative connotation will yield a prediction of \"negative\nsentiment\".import turicreate as tc\n\n# Load data\ndata = tc.SFrame('ratings_data.csv')\n\n# Create a model\nmodel = tc.text_classifier.create(data, 'rating', features=['text'])\n\n# Make predictions & evaluation the model\npredictions = model.predict(data)\nresults = model.evaluate(data)\n\n# Save the model for later use in Turi Create\nmodel.save('MyTextClassifier.model')\n\n# Export for use in Core ML\nmodel.export_coreml('MySentenceClassifier.mlmodel')\n\nHow it worksTraining a text classifier is really important when you want to tune the\nmodel to your data set to take advantage of vocabulary that is\nparticular to your application. The text classifier in Turi Create is\ncurrently a simple combination of two components:feature engineering:  a bag-of-words\ntransformation\n\nstatistical model: a LogisticClassifier is used to classify text based\non the above features\n\nThe bag-of-words and a logistic regression classifier is a very strong\nbaseline for this particular task and works on a wide variety of\ndatasets.After creating the above model, you can inspect the underlying\nclassifier model using:classifier = model.classifier\nDeploying to Core MLYou can use the trained text classifier in Xcode by exporting it to Core ML. Exporting is done by:model.export_coreml('MySentenceClassifier.mlmodel')\nDragging the saved model into Xcode and inspecting it looks like the following:\nThe model expects a bag-of-words representation of the input text. In Swift, we can use the NSLinguisticTagger to parse the input string into words and create this representation. The example below demonstrates how to use the NSLinguisticTagger, and get predictions from the exported model.func bow(text: String) -> [String: Double] {\n    var bagOfWords = [String: Double]()\n\n    let tagger = NSLinguisticTagger(tagSchemes: [.tokenType], options: 0)\n    let range = NSRange(location: 0, length: text.utf16.count)\n    let options: NSLinguisticTagger.Options = [.omitPunctuation, .omitWhitespace]\n    tagger.string = text.lowercased()\n\n    tagger.enumerateTags(in: range, unit: .word, scheme: .tokenType, options: options) { _, tokenRange, _ in\n        let word = (text as NSString).substring(with: tokenRange)\n        if bagOfWords[word] != nil {\n            bagOfWords[word]! += 1\n        } else {\n            bagOfWords[word] = 1\n        }\n    }\n\n    return bagOfWords\n}\n\nlet bagOfWords = bow(text: text)\nlet prediction = try?

For instance, a\nclassifier could take an image and predict whether it is a cat or a dog.\nThe pieces of information fed to a classifier for each data point are\ncalled features, and the category they belong to is a ‘target’ or\n‘label’.  Typically, the classifier is given data points with both\nfeatures and labels, so that it can learn the correspondence between the\ntwo. Later, the classifier is queried with a data point and the\nclassifier tries to predict what category it belongs to. A large group\nof these query data-points constitute a prediction-set, and the\nclassifier is usually evaluated on its accuracy, or how many prediction\nqueries it gets correct.There are many methods to perform classification, such as SVMs, logistic\nregression, deep learning, and more.

Note that this is not the same as the\nprobability estimate in the classify function.\n\nMargins : Distance to the linear decision boundary learned by the model.\nThe larger the distance, the more confidence we have that it belongs to one\nclass or the other.\n\nTuri Create's logistic regression model can return\npredictions\nfor any of these types:pred_class = model.predict(test_data, output_type = \"class\")          # Class\npred_prob_one = model.predict(test_data, output_type = 'probability') # Probability\npred_margin = model.predict(test_data, output_type = \"margin\")        # Margins\n  Evaluating ResultsWe can also evaluate our predictions by comparing them to known ratings.

Suppose we have n training\ndata points, where the i'th point has both a vector of features x_i and\nclass label y_i. For a new point x^*, the nearest neighbor classifier\nfirst finds the set of neighbors of x^*, denoted N(x^*). The class label\nfor x^* is then predicted to be\n    y* = \\max_c \\sum_{i \\in N(x^*)} I(y_i = c)\nwhere the indicator function I() is 1 if the argument is true, and 0\notherwise. The simplicity of this approach makes the model relatively\nstraightforward to understand and communicate to others, and naturally lends\nitself to multi-class classification.Defining the criteria for the neighborhood of a prediction data point\nrequires careful thought and domain knowledge. A function must be specified to\nmeasure the distance between any two data points, and then the size of\n\"neighborhoods\" relative to this distance function must be set.For the first step, there are many standard distance functions (e.g.\nEuclidean, Jaccard, Levenshtein) that work well for data whose features\nare all of the same type, but for heterogeneous data the task is a bit\ntrickier. Turi Create overcomes this problem with composite\ndistances, which are weighted sums of standard distance functions\napplied to appropriate subsets of features. For more about distance\nfunctions in Turi Create, including composite distances, please see the\nAPI documentation for the distances\nmodule.\nThe end of this chapter describes how to use a composite distance with\nthe nearest neighbor classifier in particular.Once the distance function is defined, the user must indicate the\ncriteria for deciding when training data are in the \"neighborhood\" of a\nprediction point.  This is done by setting two constraints:radius - the maximum distance a training example can be from the prediction\npoint and still be considered a neighbor, and\nmax_neighbors - the maximum number of neighbors for the prediction point.\nIf there are more points within radius of the prediction point, the closest\nmax_neighbors are used.\nUnlike the other classifiers in the Turi Create classifier toolkit, the\nnearest neighbors classifiers is an instance-based method, which means that\nthe model must store all of the training data. For each prediction, the model\nmust search all of the training data to find the neighbor points in the training\ndata. Turi Create performs this search intelligently, but predictions are\nnevertheless typically slower than other classification models.Basic ExampleTo illustrate basic usage of the nearest neighbor classifier, we again\nuse restaurant review data, with the goal of predicting how\nmany \"stars\" a user will give a particular business. Anticipating that\nwe will want to test the validity of the model, we first split the data\ninto training and testing subsets.import turicreate as tc\n\ndata =  tc.SFrame('ratings-data.csv')\ntrain_data, test_data = data.random_split(0.9)\nIn this example we build a classifier using only the four numeric\nfeatures listed in the logistic regression chapter, namely the average\nstars awarded by each user and to each business and the total count of\nreviews given by each user and to each business. The review counts\nfeatures are typically much larger than the average stars features,\nwhich would cause the review counts to dominate standard numeric\ndistance functions. To avoid this we standardize the features before\ncreating the model.numeric_features = ['user_avg_stars', \n                    'business_avg_stars', \n                    'user_review_count', \n                    'business_review_count']\n\nfor ftr in numeric_features:\n    mean = train_data[ftr].mean()\n    stdev = train_data[ftr].std()\n    train_data[ftr] = (train_data[ftr] - mean) / stdev\n    test_data[ftr] = (test_data[ftr] - mean) / stdev\nFinally, we create the model and generate predictions.m = tc.nearest_neighbor_classifier.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                          features=numeric_features)\npredictions = m.classify(test_data, max_neighbors=20, radius=None)\nprint(predictions)\n+-------+-------------+\n| class | probability |\n+-------+-------------+\n|   4   |     0.65    |\n|   4   |     0.5     |\n|   5   |     0.8     |\n|   5   |     0.65    |\n|   5   |     1.0     |\n|   4   |     0.55    |\n|   4   |     0.35    |\n|   3   |     0.45    |\n|   4   |     0.45    |\n|   5   |     0.4     |\n+-------+-------------+\n[21466 rows x 2 columns]\nNote: Only the head of the SFrame is printed.\nYou can use print_rows(num_rows=m, num_columns=n) to print more rows and columns.\nAdvanced UsageThe classify method returns an SFrame with both the predicted class and the\nprobability score of that class, which is simply the fraction of the points'\nneighbors which belong to the most common class.

The most common class (4 stars) only occurs in\n34.8% of the test data, so our model has indeed learned something. The\nconfusion matrix produced by the evaluate method can help us to better\nunderstand the model performance.

One way to do\nthis is to treat each entry as a \"bag of words\" by simply counting the\nnumber of times each word appears but ignoring the order (please see the\ntext analytics chapter for more detail).train_data['word_counts'] = tc.text_analytics.count_words(train_data['text'],\n                                                          to_lower=True)\ntest_data['word_counts'] = tc.text_analytics.count_words(test_data['text'],\n                                                         to_lower=True)\nFor example, the (abbreviated) text of the first review in the training\nset is:My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent. The\nweather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an\nabsolute pleasure....while the (also abbreviated) bag-of-words representation is a dictionary\nthat maps each word to the number of times that word appears:{'2': 1, 'a': 1, 'absolute': 1, 'absolutely': 1, 'amazing': 2, 'an': 1,\n'and': 8, 'anyway': 1, 'arrived': 1, 'back': 1, 'best': 2, 'better': 1,\n'birthday': 1, 'blend': 1, 'bloody': 1, 'bread': 1, 'breakfast': 1, ... }\nThe weighted_jaccard distance measures the difference between two\nsets, weighted by the counts of each element (please see the API\ndocumentation\nfor details). To combine this output with the numeric distance we used\nabove, we specify a composite distance. Each element in this list\nincludes a list (or tuple) of feature names, a standard distance\nfunction name, and a numeric weight. The weight on each component can be\nadjusted to produce the same effect as normalizing features.my_dist = [\n    [numeric_features, 'euclidean', 1.0],\n    [['word_counts'], 'weighted_jaccard', 1.0]\n    ]\n\nm2 = tc.nearest_neighbor_classifier.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                          distance=my_dist)\naccuracy = m2.evaluate(test_data[:3000], metric='accuracy')\nprint(accuracy)\n{'accuracy': 0.482}\nAdding the text feature appears to slightly improve the accuracy of our\nclassifier.

In logistic regression, the probability that a\nbinary target is True is modeled as a logistic\nfunction of the\nfeatures. The following figure illustrates how an SVM is used to create a\n2-dimensional classifier. The training data consists of positive\nexamples (depicted in orange) and negative examples (in blue). The\ndecision boundary (depicted in pink) separates out the data into two\nclasses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackgroundCurrently, Turi Create implements a linear C-SVM (SVC). In this model, given\na set of features x_i, and a label y_i \\in \\{0,1\\} the linear SVM minimizes\nthe loss function:\n          f_i(\\theta) =  \\max(1 - \\theta^T x, 0)\nAs with other models, an intercept term is added by appending a column of 1's to\nthe features. The composite objective being\noptimized for is the following:\n           \\min_{\\theta} \\lambda \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} f_i(\\theta) + \\|\\theta \\|^{2}_{2}\nwhere \\lambda is the penalty parameter (the C in the C-SVM) that\ndetermines the weight in the loss function towards the regularizer. The larger\nthe value of \\lambda, the more is the weight given to the mis-classification\nloss. Turi Create solves the Linear-SVM formulation by approximating the\nhinge-loss with a smooth function (see\nZhang et. al.\nfor details).Introductory ExampleUsing the same example as we did for logistic regression, we will predict if a\nrestaurant is good or bad, with 1 and 2 star ratings indicating a bad business\nand 3-5 star ratings indicating a good one. We will use the following features:Average rating of a given business\n\nAverage rating made by a user\n\nNumber of reviews made by a user\n\nNumber of reviews that concern a business\n\nThe usage is similar to the logistic regression module:import turicreate as tc\n\n# Load the data\ndata =  tc.SFrame('ratings-data.csv')\n\n# Restaurants with rating >=3 are good\ndata['is_good'] = data['stars'] >= 3\n\n# Make a train-test split\ntrain_data, test_data = data.random_split(0.8)\n\n# Create a model.\nmodel = tc.svm_classifier.create(train_data, target='is_good',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count'])\n\n# Save predictions (class only) to an SFrame\npredictions = model.predict(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary\nresults = model.evaluate(test_data)\nAdvanced UsageRefer to the chapter on linear regression for the following features:Accessing attributes of the model\n\nInterpreting results\n\nUsing categorical features\n\nSparse features\n\nList features\n\nFeature rescaling\n\nChosing the solver\n\nRegularizing models\n\nEvaluating Results\n\nWorking with imbalanced data\n\nWe will now discuss some advanced features that are specific to SVM.Making PredictionsPredictions using a Turi classifier is easy.

The smaller this weight, the lower is the emphasis placed on\nmisclassified examples which in-turn results in smaller coefficients. The\npenalty term can be set as follows:model = tc.svm_classifier.create(train_data, target='is_good', penalty=100,\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count'])\n"},"supervised-learning/export-coreml.html":{"url":"supervised-learning/export-coreml.html","title":"Deployment to Core ML","keywords":"","body":"Deploying to Core MLWith Core ML, you can integrate machine learning models into your macOS,\niOS, watchOS, and tvOS app. Classification and regression models created\nin Turi Create can be exported for use in Core ML.

Initial cluster centers are\nchosen with the K-means++ algorithm (if not provided explicitly by the user).\nThis algorithm chooses cluster centers that are far apart with high probability,\nwhich tends to reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence, and make\nit less likely that the method returns sub-optimal results.In addition, Turi Create's K-means uses the triangle inequality to reduce\nthe number of exact distances that need to be computed in each iteration.\nConceptually, if we know that a data point x is close to center A, which\nis in turn far from center B, then there is no need to compute the exact\ndistance from point x to center B when assigning x to a cluster.Basic UsageWe illustrate usage of Turi Create K-means with the dataset from the June\n2014 Kaggle competition to classify schizophrenic subjects based on MRI\nscans.

Somewhat counter-intuitively, the results for minibatch K-means\ntend to be very similar to the exact algorithm, despite typically using only a\nsmall fraction of the training data in each iteration.

Density-based\nclustering algorithms attempt to capture our intuition that a cluster — a\ndifficult term to define precisely — is a region of the data space where\nthere are lots of points, surrounded by a region where there are few points.\nDBSCAN does this by partitioning the input data points into three types:Core points have a large number of other points within a given neighborhood. The\nparameter min_core_neighbors defines how many points counts as a \"large\nnumber\", while the radius parameter defines how large the neighborhoods are\naround each point. Specifically, a point y is in the neighborhood of pointx if d(x, y)  radius, where d is a user-specified distance\nfunction.\nBoundary points are within distance radius of a core point, but don't\nhave sufficient neighbors of their own to be considered core.\nNoise points comprise the remainder of the data. These points have too\nfew neighbors to be considered core points, and are further than distance\nradius from all core points.\nClusters are formed by connecting core points that are neighbors of each other,\nthen assigning boundary points to their nearest core neighbor's cluster. Noise\npoints are left unassigned.DBSCAN tends to be slower than K-means because it requires computation of the\nsimilarity graph on the input dataset, but it has several major conceptual\nadvantages:The number of clusters does not need to be known a priori; DBSCAN detects the\noptimum number of clusters automatically for the given values of\nmin_core_neighbors and radius.\nDBSCAN recovers much more flexible cluster shapes than K-means, which can only\nfind spherical clusters.\nDBSCAN intrinsically finds and labels outliers as such, making it a great tool\nfor outlier and anomaly detection.\nDBSCAN works with any distance function. Note that results may be poor for\ndistances that do not obey standard properties of distances, i.e. symmetry,\nnon-negativity, triangle inequality, and identity of indiscernibles. The\ndistances \"euclidean\", \"manhattan\", \"jaccard\", and \"levenshtein\" will likely\nyield the best results.\nBasic usageTo illustrate the basic usage of DBSCAN and how the results can differ from\nK-means, we simulate non-spherical, low-dimensional data using the scikit-learn\ndatasets module.1import turicreate as tc\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_moons\n\ndata = make_moons(n_samples=200, shuffle=True, noise=0.1, random_state=19)\nsf = tc.SFrame(data[0]).unpack('X1')\n\ndbscan_model = tc.dbscan.create(sf, radius=0.25)\ndbscan_model.summary()\nClass                                   : DBSCANModel\n\nSchema\n------\nNumber of examples                      : 200\nNumber of feature columns               : 2\nMax distance to a neighbor (radius)     : 0.25\nMin number of neighbors for core points : 10\nNumber of distance components           : 1\n\nTraining summary\n----------------\nTotal training time (seconds)           : 0.1954\nNumber of clusters                      : 2\n\nAccessible fields\n-----------------\n   cluster_id                           : Cluster label for each row in the input dataset.\nLike the K-means model, the assignments of points to clusters is in the models'\ncluster-id field. The second column shows the cluster assignment for the row\nindex of the input data indicated by the first column. The third column shows\nwhether DBSCAN considers the point core, boundary, or noise. Noise points\nare not assigned to a cluster, which is encoded as a \"missing\" value in the\n'cluster_id' column.dbscan_model['cluster_id'].head(5)\n+--------+------------+------+\n| row_id | cluster_id | type |\n+--------+------------+------+\n|  175   |     1      | core |\n|  136   |     0      | core |\n|   33   |     1      | core |\n|  113   |     0      | core |\n|  110   |     1      | core |\n+--------+------------+------+\n[5 rows x 3 columns]\ndbscan_model['cluster_id'].tail(5)\n+--------+------------+----------+\n| row_id | cluster_id |   type   |\n+--------+------------+----------+\n|   53   |     0      | boundary |\n|   4    |     1      | boundary |\n|   43   |     0      | boundary |\n|  116   |     0      | boundary |\n|   74   |    None    |  noise   |\n+--------+------------+----------+\n[5 rows x 3 columns]\nBecause we generated 2D data, we can plot it and color the points according to\nthe cluster assignments generated by our DBSCAN model. The first step is to join\nthe cluster results back to the original data. Please note: DBSCAN scrambles the\nrow order - be careful!Next we define boolean masks so we can plot the core, boundary, and noise points\nseparately. Boundary points are drawn smaller than core points, and\n(unclustered) noise points are left black. Some plotting code is omitted for\nbrevity.\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\nsf = sf.add_row_number('row_id')\nsf = sf.join(dbscan_model['cluster_id'], on='row_id', how='left')\nsf = sf.rename({'cluster_id': 'dbscan_id'})\n\ncore_mask = sf['type'] == 'core'\nboundary_mask = sf['type'] == 'boundary'\nnoise_mask = sf['type'] == 'noise'\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.scatter(sf['X1.0'][core_mask], sf['X1.1'][core_mask], s=80, alpha=0.9,\n           c=sf['dbscan_id'][core_mask], cmap=plt.cm.Set1)\n\nax.scatter(sf['X1.0'][boundary_mask], sf['X1.1'][boundary_mask], s=40,\n           alpha=0.7, c=sf['dbscan_id'][boundary_mask], cmap=plt.cm.Set1)\n\nax.scatter(sf['X1.0'][noise_mask], sf['X1.1'][noise_mask], s=40, alpha=0.7,\n           c='black')\nfig.show()\nFor comparison, K-means cannot identify the true clusters in this case, even\nwhen we tell the model the correct number of clusters.\n\n\nkmeans_model = tc.kmeans.create(sf, features=['X1.0', 'X1.1'], num_clusters=2)\nsf['kmeans_id'] = kmeans_model['cluster_id']['cluster_id']\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.scatter(sf['X1.0'], sf['X1.1'], s=80, alpha=0.9, c=sf['kmeans_id'],\n           cmap=plt.cm.Set1)\nfig.show()\nSetting key parametersDBSCAN is particularly useful when the number of clusters is not known a\npriori, but it can be tricky to set the radius and min_core_neighbors\nparameters. To improve the quality of DBSCAN results, try the following:When radius is too large or min_core_neighbors is too small, every point\nbeing labeled as a core point, often connected as a single cluster. If your\ncreated model has a single cluster with only core points (and you suspect this\nis incorrect), try decreasing the radius parameter or increasing the\nmin_core_neighbors parameter.\nConversely, if DBSCAN labels all points as noise, with no clusters returned at\nall, try increasing the radius or decreasing the min_core_neighbors.\nUse the Turi Create nearest neighbors toolkit to construct a\nsimilarity graph on the data and plot the distribution of distances with\nCanvas. This will give you a sense for reasonable values of the radius\nparameter, then the min_core_neighbors parameter can be tuned by itself for\noptimal results.\nChoosing the distance functionDBSCAN is not restricted to Euclidean distances. The Turi Create\nimplementation allows any distance function---including composite distances---to\nbe used with DBSCAN. This allows for a tremendous amount of flexibility in terms\nof data types and tuning for optimal clustering quality. To demonstrate this\nflexibility we'll use DBSCAN with Jaccard distance to deduplicate wikipedia\narticles.import turicreate as tc\n\nsf = tc.SFrame.read_csv('wikipedia-data.csv', header=False)\nsf.save('wikipedia.sframe')\nThis particular subset of wikipedia has over 72,000 documents; in the interest\nof speed for the demo we sample 20% of this. We also preprocess the data by\nconstructing a bag-of-words representation for each article and trimming out\nstop words. See Turi Create's text analytics and\nSArray\ndocumentation for more details.sf_sample = sf.sample(0.2)\nsf_sample['word_bag'] = tc.text_analytics.count_words(sf_sample['X1'])\nsf_sample['word_bag'] = sf_sample['word_bag'].dict_trim_by_keys(\n                                    tc.text_analytics.stop_words(), exclude=True)\nWith our trimmed bag of words representation, Jaccard distance is a natural\nchoice. For the purpose of deduplication we want to identify points as \"core\" if\nthey have any near neighbors at all, so we set min_core_neighbors to 1. To\ndefine what we mean by \"near\" we set the radius parameter somewhat arbitrarily\nat 0.5; this means that two points are considered neighbors if they share 50% or\nmore of the words present in either article.wiki_cluster = tc.dbscan.create(sf_sample, features=['word_bag'],\n                                distance='jaccard', radius=0.5,\n                                min_core_neighbors=1)\nwiki_cluster.summary()\nClass                                   : DBSCANModel\n\nSchema\n------\nNumber of examples                      : 14265\nNumber of feature columns               : 1\nMax distance to a neighbor (radius)     : 0.5\nMin number of neighbors for core points : 1\nNumber of distance components           : 1\n\nTraining summary\n----------------\nTotal training time (seconds)           : 35.1235\nNumber of clusters                      : 88\n\nAccessible fields\n-----------------\n   cluster_id                           : Cluster label for each row in the input dataset.\nFrom the model summary we see there are 88 clusters in the set of 14,265\ndocuments.

For dense data, Turi Create\ncomputes some distances much faster than others, namely \"euclidean\",\n\"squared_euclidean\", \"cosine\", and \"transformed_dot_product\". Other\ndistances, as well as all distances with sparse data, may result in longer\nrun times.\nDBSCAN does not explicitly require the standard distance properties\n(symmetry, non-negativity, triangle inequality, and identity of\nindiscernibles) to hold, but it is based on connecting high-density points\nwhich are close to each other into a single cluster. If the specified\nnotion of closeness violates the usual distance properties, DBSCAN may yield\ncounterintuitive results. We expect to see the most intuitive results with\n\"euclidean\", \"manhattan\", \"jaccard\", and \"levenshtein\" distances.\nReferences and more informationEster, M., et al.

Each of these methods is explained further\nbelow.For this chapter we use an example dataset of house attributes and prices:import turicreate as tc\nsf = tc.SFrame.read_csv('houses.csv')\nsf.head(5)\n+------+---------+------+--------+------+-------+\n| tax  | bedroom | bath | price  | size |  lot  |\n+------+---------+------+--------+------+-------+\n| 590  |    2    | 1.0  | 50000  | 770  | 22100 |\n| 1050 |    3    | 2.0  | 85000  | 1410 | 12000 |\n|  20  |    3    | 1.0  | 22500  | 1060 |  3500 |\n| 870  |    2    | 2.0  | 90000  | 1300 | 17500 |\n| 1320 |    3    | 2.0  | 133000 | 1500 | 30000 |\n+------+---------+------+--------+------+-------+\n[5 rows x 6 columns]\nBecause the features in this dataset have very different scales (e.g. price is\nin the hundreds of thousands while the number of bedrooms is in the single\ndigits), it is important to normalize the features. In this example we\nstandardize so that each feature is measured in terms of standard deviations\nfrom the mean (see Wikipedia for more\ndetail).

For this task of\nconstructing the similarity_graph on the reference data, the model's\nsimilarity_graph can be used. For brute force models it can be almost twice as\nfast, depending on the data sparsity and chosen distance function. By default,\nthe similarity_graph method returns an\nSGraph\nwhose vertices are the rows of the reference dataset and whose edges indicate a\nnearest neighbor match. Specifically, the destination vertex of an edge is a\nnearest neighbor of the source vertex. similarity_graph can also return\nresults in the same form as the query method if so desired.sim_graph = model.similarity_graph(k=3)\nDistance functionsThe most critical choice in computing nearest neighbors is the\ndistance function that measures the dissimilarity between any pair\nof observations.For numeric data, the options are euclidean, manhattan,\ncosine, and transformed_dot_product. For data in dictionary\nformat (i.e. sparse data), jaccard and weighted_jaccard are also\noptions, in addition to the numeric distances. For string features, use\nlevenshtein distance, or use the text analytics toolkit's\ncount_ngrams feature to convert strings to dictionaries of words or\ncharacter shingles, then use Jaccard or weighted Jaccard distance.\nLeaving the distance parameter set to its default value of auto\ntells the model to choose the most reasonable distance based on the type\nof features in the reference data.

This allows us not only to specify the distance argument for a\nnearest neighbors model as a distance function (rather than a string),\nbut also to use that function for any other purpose.In the following snippet we use a nearest neighbors model to find the\nclosest reference points to the first three rows of our dataset, then\nconfirm the results by computing a couple of the distances manually with\nthe Manhattan distance function.model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['bedroom', 'bath', 'size'],\n                                    distance=tc.distances.manhattan)\nknn = model.query(sf[:3], k=3)\nknn.print_rows()\n\nsf_check = sf[['bedroom', 'bath', 'size']]\nprint \"distance check 1:\", tc.distances.manhattan(sf_check[2], sf_check[10])\nprint \"distance check 2:\", tc.distances.manhattan(sf_check[2], sf_check[14])\n+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+------+\n| query_label | reference_label |     distance    | rank |\n+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+------+\n|      0      |        0        |       0.0       |  1   |\n|      0      |        5        |  0.100742954001 |  2   |\n|      0      |        7        |  0.805943632008 |  3   |\n|      1      |        1        |       0.0       |  1   |\n|      1      |        8        |  0.181337317202 |  2   |\n|      1      |        4        |  0.181337317202 |  3   |\n|      2      |        2        |       0.0       |  1   |\n|      2      |        10       | 0.0604457724006 |  2   |\n|      2      |        14       |  1.61656820464  |  3   |\n+-------------+-----------------+-----------------+------+\n[9 rows x 4 columns\n\ndistance check 1: 0.0604457724006\ndistance check 2: 1.61656820464\nTuri Create also allows composite distances, which allow the nearest\nneighbors tool (and other distance-based tools) to work with features\nthat have different types. Specifically, a composite distance is a\nweighted sum of standard distances applied to subsets of features,\nspecified in the form of a Python list. Each element of a composite\ndistance list contains three things:a list or tuple of feature names\n\na standard distance name\n\na multiplier for the standard distance.\n\nIn our house price dataset, for example, suppose we want to measure the\ndifference between numbers of bedrooms and baths with Manhattan distance\nand the difference between house and lot sizes with Euclidean distance.\nIn addition, we want the Euclidean component to carry twice as much\nweight. The composite distance for this would be:my_dist = [[['bedroom', 'bath'], 'manhattan', 1],\n           [['size', 'lot'], 'euclidean', 2]]\nThis list can be passed to the distance parameter just like a standard\ndistance function name or handle.model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, distance=my_dist)\nmodel.summary()\nClass                         : NearestNeighborsModel\n\nAttributes\n----------\nMethod                        : brute_force\nNumber of distance components : 2\nNumber of examples            : 15\nNumber of feature columns     : 4\nNumber of unpacked features   : 4\nTotal training time (seconds) : 0.0017\nIf we specify the distance parameter as auto, a composite distance\nis created where each type of feature is paired with the most\nappropriate distance function. Please see the documentation for the\nTuri Create distances\nmodule\nfor more on composite distances.Search methodsAnother important choice in model creation is the method. The\nbrute_force method computes the distance between a query point and each of\nthe reference points, with a run time linear in the number of reference points.\nCreating a model with the ball_tree method takes more time, but leads to\nmuch faster queries by partitioning the reference data into successively smaller\nballs and searching only those that are relatively close to the query.  The\ndefault method is auto which chooses a reasonable method based on both the\nfeature types and the selected distance function. The method parameter is also\nspecified when the model is created. The third row of the model summary confirms\nour choice to use the ball tree in the next example.model = tc.nearest_neighbors.create(sf, features=['bedroom', 'bath', 'size'],\n                                    method='ball_tree', leaf_size=5)\nmodel.summary()\nClass                         : NearestNeighborsModel\n\nAttributes\n----------\nMethod                        : ball_tree\nNumber of distance components : 1\nNumber of examples            : 15\nNumber of feature columns     : 3\nNumber of unpacked features   : 3\nTotal training time (seconds) : 0.0253\n\nBall Tree Attributes\n--------------------\nTree depth                    : 3\nLeaf size                     : 5\nIf the ball tree is used, it's important to choose an appropriate value for the\n'leaf_size' parameter, which controls how many observations are stored in each\nleaf of the ball tree. By default, this is set so that the tree is no more than\n12 levels deep, but larger or smaller values may lead to quicker queries\ndepending on the shape and dimension of the data. Our houses example only has 15\nrows, so the leaf_size parameter (and the ball_tree method for that\nmatter) are not too useful, but for illustration purposes we set the leaf size\nto 5 above.Missing dataThe reference dataset that is used to create the nearest neighbors model\ncannot have missing data. Please use the\nSFrame.fillna\nand\nSFrame.dropna\nutilities to preprocess missing values before creating a nearest\nneighbors model.On the other hand, data passed to the query method can have missing\ndata.  For numeric columns, missing values are imputed to be the mean of\nthe corresponding column in the reference dataset used to create the\nmodel.

More\nformally we can write this class of models as:\n    g(x) = f_0(x) + f_1(x) + f_2(x) + ...\nwhere the final classifier g is the sum of simple base classifiers f_i.\nFor boosted trees model, each base classifier is a simple decision\ntree. This broad technique of\nusing multiple models to obtain better predictive performance is called\nmodel ensembling.Unlike Random Forest which constructs all the base classifier independently,\neach using a subsample of data, GBRT uses a particular model ensembling\ntechnique called gradient boosting.The name of Gradient Boosting comes from its connection to the Gradient Descent\nin numerical optimization. Suppose you want to optimize a function f(x),\nassuming f is differentiable, gradient descent works by iteratively find\n  x_{t+1} = x_{t} - \\eta \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x = x_t}\nwhere \\eta is called the step size.Similarly, if we let g_t(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} f_i(x) be the classifier\ntrained at iteration t, and L(y_i, g(x_i)) be the empirical loss function,\nat each iteration we will move g_t towards the negative gradient\ndirection -\\left.\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g} \\right|_{g = g_t} by \\eta amount.\nHence, f_{t} is chosen to be\n  f_t = \\arg\\min_{f}\\sum_{i=1}^N [\\left.\\frac{\\partial L(y_i, g(x_i))}{\\partial g(x_i)}\\right|_{g=g_t} - f(x_i)]^2\nand the algorithm sets g_{t+1} = g_{t} + \\eta f_t.For regression problems with squared loss function, \\frac{\\partial L(y_i, g(x_i))}{\\partial g(x_i)} is simply y_i - g(x_i).\nThe algorithm simply fit a new decision tree to the residual at each iteration.Introductory ExampleIn this example, we will use the Mushrooms dataset.1import turicreate as tc\n\n# Load the data\ndata =  tc.SFrame.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/turicreate/master/src/unity/python/turicreate/test/mushroom.csv')\n\n# Label 'p' is edible\ndata['label'] = data['label'] == 'p'\n\n# Make a train-test split\ntrain_data, test_data = data.random_split(0.8)\n\n# Create a model.\nmodel = tc.boosted_trees_regression.create(train_data, target='label',\n                                           max_iterations=2,\n                                           max_depth =  3)\n\n# Save predictions to an SArray\npredictions = model.predict(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary\nresults = model.evaluate(test_data)\nTuning hyperparametersThe Gradient Boosted Trees model has many tuning parameters. Here we provide a simple guideline for tuning the model.max_iterations\nControls the number of trees in the final model. Usually the more trees, the higher accuracy.\nHowever, both the training and prediction time also grows linearly in the number of trees.\nmax_depth\nRestricts the depth of each individual tree to prevent overfitting.\nstep_size\nAlso called shrinkage, appeared as the \\eta in the equations in the Background section.\nIt works similar to the learning rate of the gradient descent procedure: smaller value\nwill take more iterations to reach the same level of training error of a larger step size.\nSo there is a trade off between step_size and number of iterations.\nmin_child_weight\nOne of the pruning criteria for decision tree construction. In classification problem, this\ncorresponds to the minimum observations required at a leaf node. Larger value\nproduces simpler trees.\nmin_loss_reduction\nAnother pruning criteria for decision tree construction. This restricts the reduction of\nloss function for a node split. Larger value produces simpler trees.\nrow_subsample\nUse only a fraction of data at each iteration. This is\nsimilar to the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent\nwhich not only reduce the computation cost of each iteration, but may also produce\nmore robust model.\ncolumn_subsample\nUse only a subset of the columns to use at each iteration.\nIn general, you can choose max_iterations to be large and fit your computation budget.\nYou can then set min_child_weight to be a reasonable value around\n(#instances/1000), and tune max_depth. When you have more training instances,\nyou can set max_depth to a higher value. When you find a large gap between\nthe training loss and validation loss, a sign of overfitting, you may want\nto reduce depth, and increase min_child_weight.When to use a boosted trees model?Different kinds of models have different advantages.

This is a two-stage process, analogous to many other\nTuri toolkits. First a model is created using training data. Once\nthe model is created, it can then be used to make predictions on new\nexamples that were not seen in training (the  test data). Model\ncreation, prediction, and evaluation work will data that is contained in\nan SFrame. The following figure illustrates how linear regression works.\nNotice that the functional form learned here is a linear function\n(unlike the previous figure where the predicted function was\nnon-linear).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackgroundGiven a set of features x_i, and a label y_i (where i\ndenotes a single example in the training data), linear regression\nassumes that the target y_i is a linear combination of the featuresx_i i.e\n\n```\ny_i = f_i(\\theta) =  \\theta^T x + \\epsilon_i\n```\n\n\n\nwhere \\epsilon_i is random Gaussian noise with mean 0 and\nvariance \\sigma.  An intercept term is added by appending a\ncolumn of 1's to the features.  Regularization is often required to\nprevent over-fitting by penalizing models with extreme parameter values.\nThe linear regression module supports L1 and L2\nregularization,\nwhich are added to the loss function.The composite objective being optimized for is the following:\n\n\n\n```\n\\min_{\\theta} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (\\theta^Tx - y_i)^2 + \\lambda_1 \\|\\theta\\|_1 + \\lambda_2 \\|\\theta\\|_2^2\n```\n\n\n\nwhere \\lambda_1 is the l1_penalty and \\lambda_2 is the l2_penalty.Introductory ExampleSuppose we have a dataset containing restaurant reviews. The\ntask is to predict the 'star rating' for a restaurant for a given\nuser.We will first split the data into a train-test split and then create a linear\nregression model that can predict the star rating for each review using:Average rating of a given business\n\nAverage rating made by a user\n\nNumber of reviews made by a user\n\nNumber of reviews that concern a business\n\nimport turicreate as tc\n\n# Load the data\ndata =  tc.SFrame('ratings-data.csv')\n\n# Make a train-test split\ntrain_data, test_data = data.random_split(0.8)\n\n# Create a model.\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count'])\n\n# Save predictions to an SFrame (class and corresponding class-probabilities)\npredictions = model.predict(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary\nresults = model.evaluate(test_data)\nAdditional FeaturesWe will now go over some more advanced options with the linear regression\nmodule. This includes regularization, evaluation options, model interpretation,\nand missing value handling.  Note that logistic regression and support vector\nmachines (SVM) conform to almost all of the API discussed below.Accessing attributes of the modelThe attributes of all Turi Create models, which include training statistics, model\nhyper-parameters, and model results can be accessed in the same way as python\ndictionaries.Interpreting resultsLinear regression can provide valuable insight about the relationships between\nthe target and feature columns in your data, revealing why your model returns\nthe predictions that it does. The coefficients (\\theta) are what the\ntraining procedure learns. Each model coefficient describes the expected change\nin the target variable associated with a unit change in the feature. The bias\nterm indicates the \"inherent\" or \"average\" target value if all feature values\nwere set to zero.The coefficients often tell an interesting story of how much each feature\nmatters in predicting target values. The magnitude (absolute value) of the\ncoefficient for each feature indicates the strength of the feature's association\nto the target variable, holding all other features constant. The sign on the\ncoefficient (positive or negative) gives the direction of the association.When a Turi Create regression model is trained, the model.summary() output\nshows the largest positive and negative coefficients. After a model is\ncreated, we can access the coefficients as follows:coefs = model.coefficients\nprint(coefs)\n+-----------------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|          name         | index |       value       |       stderr      |\n+-----------------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|      (intercept)      |  None |   -2.22993154648  |  0.0199750718984  |\n|     user_avg_stars    |  None |   0.809669227421  |  0.00414406824672 |\n|   business_avg_stars  |  None |   0.781099022798  |  0.00419064940637 |\n|   user_review_count   |  None | 1.85023282568e-05 | 1.15481783547e-05 |\n| business_review_count |  None | 7.06842770902e-05 | 1.72332966093e-05 |\n+-----------------------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+\n[5 rows x 3 columns]\nNote that the index column in the coefficients is only applicable for\ncategorical features, lists, and dictionaries. In the SFrame above, there is an\nextra column for standard errors on the estimated coefficients (see section\nbelow for a more detailed explanation). Standard-errorsThe standard error is the empirical standard deviation on the estimated\ncoefficient. For example, a coefficient of 1 with a standard error of 0.5\nimplies a standard deviation of 0.5 on the estimated values of the\ncoefficients. Standard errors capture the confidence we have in the\ncoefficients estimated during model creation. Smaller standard errors implies\nmore confidence in the value of the coefficients returned by th model.Standard errors on coefficients are only available when solver=newton or\nwhen the default auto solver option chooses the newton method and if the\nnumber of examples in the training data is more than the number of\ncoefficients. If standard errors cannot be estimated, a column of None values\nare returned.Categorical featuresCategorical variables are features that can take one of a limited, and usually\nfixed, number of possible values. Each category is referred to as a level. As an\nexample, consider the variable city that a given restaurant is in. This\ndataset has about 60 unique strings for the city (the number of unique\nvalues in the output of Turi Canvas is approximate).city = train_data['city']\ncity.show()\nThe regression module in Turi Create uses simple encoding while\ncreating models using string features. Simple encoding compares each category\nto an arbitrary reference category (we choose the first category of the data as\nthe reference).  In other words, we add dummy coefficients to encode each\ncategory.  The number of these dummy coefficients is equal to the total number\nof categories minus 1 (for the reference category). The following figure\nillustrates how categorical variables are encoded using the simple encoding\nscheme.Now let us look at a simple example of using city as a variable in the\nlinear regression model. Notice that there is no need to do any special\npre-processing. All SFrame columns of type str are automatically\ntransformed into categorical variables. Notice that the number of\ncoefficients and the number of features aren't the same.In this example, there are 60 unique cities, so 59 dummy\ncoefficients. Turi Create can handle categorical variables with\nmillions of categories.# Create a model with categorical features.\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count',\n                                                'city'])\n\n# Number of feature columns\nprint(\"Number of features          : %s\" % model['num_features'])\n\n# Number of features (including expanded lists and dictionaries)\nprint(\"Number of unpacked features : %s\" % model['num_unpacked_features'])\n\n# Number of coefficients in the model\nprint(\"Number of coefficients      : %s\" % model['num_coefficients'])\n\n# A coefficient is included for each category\nprint(model['coefficients'])\nNumber of features          : 5\nNumber of unpacked features : 5\nNumber of coefficients      : 64\n\n+-----------------------+------------+-------------------+\n|          name         |   index    |       value       |\n+-----------------------+------------+-------------------+\n|      (intercept)      |    None    |   -2.23521785747  |\n|     user_avg_stars    |    None    |   0.812827992012  |\n|   business_avg_stars  |    None    |   0.778447236096  |\n|   user_review_count   |    None    | 2.48618619187e-05 |\n| business_review_count |    None    | 0.000102740183746 |\n|          city         |   Tempe    |  -0.0214425060978 |\n|          city         | Scottsdale | -0.00858553630484 |\n|          city         |    Mesa    |  0.0109508448699  |\n|          city         |  Chandler  |  0.0390579171569  |\n|          city         |  Gilbert   | -0.00525039510189 |\n|          ...          |    ...     |        ...        |\n+-----------------------+------------+-------------------+\n[64 rows x 3 columns]\n\nNote: Only the head of the SFrame is printed.\nYou can use print_rows(num_rows=m, num_columns=n) to print more rows and columns.\n\n Sparse featuresSparsity is one of the most important things to consider when working with\na lot of data. Sparse features are encoded using a dictionary where the keys\nrepresent the feature names and the values are the feature values.\nA coefficient is added for each key in the union of the set of keys for all\ndictionaries across all examples. For a particular example, only non-zero\nvalues need to be stored in the dictionary.  The following illustration\ndescribes how Turi Create dictionary features leverage sparsity in your\ndata.Often, the sparse representation using dictionaries is much more efficient than\nusing the dense representation.Reviews contain useful tags that describe each business. Unlike\ncategorical variables, a business may have several tags. These tags are stored\nusing dictionaries.  Not all tags are associated with every restaurant, so\nwe will only store those tags that are associated with restaurant and assume\nthat all tags not explicitly provided are treated as features with value\nzero. We illustrate with the following example:print(train_data['categories_dict'].head(3))\n[{'Breakfast & Brunch': 1, 'Restaurants': 1},\n {'Restaurants': 1, 'Pizza': 1, 'Italian': 1},\n {'Dog Parks': 1, 'Parks': 1, 'Active Life': 1}]\nWe can now create a linear regression model with categories_dict included\nin the feature list. A coefficient is added for each key encountered in the\ninput data. If the test data contains keys that were not present during\ntraining, they are silently ignored.# Create a model with dictionary features.\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count',\n                                                'categories_dict'])\n\n# Number of feature columns\nprint(\"Number of features          : %s\" % model['num_features'])\n\n# Number of features (including expanded lists and dictionaries)\nprint(\"Number of unpacked features : %s\" % model['num_unpacked_features'])\n\n# Number of coefficients in the model\nprint(\"Number of coefficients      : %s\" % model['num_coefficients'])\n\n# A coefficient is included for each key in the dictionary\nprint(model['coefficients'])\nNumber of features          : 5\nNumber of unpacked features : 511\nNumber of coefficients      : 512\n\n+-----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+\n|          name         |       index        |       value        |\n+-----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+\n|      (intercept)      |        None        |   0.872679609626   |\n|     user_avg_stars    |        None        |   0.415478142682   |\n|   business_avg_stars  |        None        |   0.363118585079   |\n|   user_review_count   |        None        | -1.13051967735e-05 |\n| business_review_count |        None        | 0.000205358202417  |\n|    categories_dict    | Breakfast & Brunch |  -0.120010958039   |\n|    categories_dict    |    Restaurants     |   0.271655570815   |\n|    categories_dict    |   Middle Eastern   |  -0.229361372902   |\n|    categories_dict    |     Dog Parks      |  -0.509799508435   |\n|    categories_dict    |       Parks        |  -0.0565527745702  |\n|          ...          |        ...         |        ...         |\n+-----------------------+--------------------+--------------------+\n[512 rows x 3 columns]\nNote: Only the head of the SFrame is printed.\nYou can use print_rows(num_rows=m, num_columns=n) to print more rows and columns.\n  List featuresTuri Create can also handle list of numerical values as features without\npreprocessing. The following illustration shows that the numeric-list feature\nis equivalent to adding several columns for each individual feature. This is\nespecially useful for image data where the number of features generated are\nlarge and may not have natural interpretations. The following figure\nillustrates this idea.As an example, we convert the votes (which stores the number of cool,\nfunny, and useful votes for each review) column into a list of features for\neach vote type.from array import array\n\n# List of features\ntrain_data['votes_list'] = train_data['votes'].apply(lambda x: x.values())\nprint(train_data['votes_list'].head(3))\n[array('d', [0.0, 5.0, 2.0]),\n array('d', [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]),\n array('d', [0.0, 2.0, 1.0])]\nNotice that the SArray of numeric lists must be of dtype array and the\narray in each row must be of the same length. The astype() function of\nthe SArray can help convert your data from type array to list.# Create a model with numeric-list features.\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count',\n                                                'votes_list'])\n\n\n# Number of feature columns\nprint(\"Number of features          : %s\" % model['num_features'])\n\n# Number of features (including expanded lists and dictionaries)\nprint(\"Number of unpacked features : %s\" % model['num_unpacked_features'])\n\n# Number of coefficients in the model\nprint(\"Number of coefficients      : %s\" % model['num_coefficients'])\n\n# A coefficient is included for each index in the list\nprint(model['coefficients'])\nNumber of features          : 5\nNumber of unpacked features : 7\nNumber of coefficients      : 8\n\n+-----------------------+-------+-------------------+\n|          name         | index |       value       |\n+-----------------------+-------+-------------------+\n|      (intercept)      |  None |   -2.02163219079  |\n|     user_avg_stars    |  None |   0.792122828319  |\n|   business_avg_stars  |  None |   0.756871316569  |\n|   user_review_count   |  None | 3.46394815858e-06 |\n| business_review_count |  None | 7.55781795366e-05 |\n|       votes_list      |   0   |  -0.0919094290658 |\n|       votes_list      |   1   |  -0.113808771262  |\n|       votes_list      |   2   |   0.201216924886  |\n+-----------------------+-------+-------------------+\n[8 rows x 3 columns]\n Feature rescalingFeature rescaling is the process of scaling individual features to be of the\nsame scale. This process is particularly useful when features vary widely in\ntheir ranges. It is well known that feature rescaling can make an enormous\nimpact on accuracy. By default, Turi Create rescales all the features to\nmake sure that they have the same L2-norm.  The data is not centered to\nmake each column of mean zero.  Categorical features, lists, and sparse\nfeatures (dictionaries), are also rescaled columnwise. The feature rescaling\ncan be disabled (only recommended for advanced users) by setting\nfeature_rescaling = False. The coefficients are scaled back to the\noriginal scale of the problem.model = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count'],\n                                    feature_rescaling = False)\n Choosing the solverThe optimization used to create the model is automatically picked based on the input data from a carefully engineered collection\nof methods. The newton\nmethod works best for datasets with plenty of examples and few features (long\ndatasets). Limited memory BFGS (lbfgs) is a robust solver for wide datasets\n(i.e datasets with many coefficients). fista is the default solver for\nL1-regularized linear regression. Gradient-descent (GD) is another well tuned\nmethod that can work really well on L1-regularized problems. The solvers are\nall automatically tuned and the default options should function well.\nSolver options can, however, be changed.  In this example, we will increase\nmax_iterations to 20 iterations. This is useful when\nmodel['solver_status'] is TERMINATED: Iteration limit reached and the\naccuracy of the model is not at a desired level.# Provide solver options in a dictionary\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_id',\n                                                'business_id',\n                                                'user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars'],\n                                    solver = 'lbfgs',\n                                    max_iterations = 20)\n What happens when the default solver fails?Whenever you have convergence trouble and the number of features is solver=newton is a good choice. The Newton method is one of the most\nstable optimization methods and works quite well if you have few coefficients.\nThe downside of the Newton method is its large computational complexity per-\niteration.Solver options guideMost solvers are all automatically tuned and the default options should function\nwell. Changing the default settings may help in some cases.step_size: The starting step size to use for the fista and gd\nsolvers. The default is set to 1.0, this is an aggressive setting. If the first\niteration is taking a considerable amount of time, then reducing the step size\nmay speed up model training. If the step size of 1.0 is accepted in the first\niteration, then consider increasing this step size to a more aggressive value.\n\nmax_iterations : The maximum number of passes through the data allowed.\nIncreasing his can result in a more accurately trained model. Consider\nincreasing this (the default value is 10) if the training accuracy is low and\nthe Grad-Norm in the display is large.\n\nconvergence_threshold: Convergence is tested using variation in the training\nobjective. The variation in the training objective is calculated by dividing the\ndifference between the objective values between two steps. Consider reducing this\nbelow the default value (0.01) for a better training data fit. Beware of\noverfitting (i.e a model that works well only on the training data) if this\nparameter is set to a very low value.\n\nlbfgs_memory_level: The L-BFGS algorithm keeps track of gradient\ninformation from the previous lbfgs_memory_level iterations. The storage\nrequirement for each of these gradients is the num_coefficients in the\nproblem. Increasing the lbfgs_memory_levelcan help improve the quality of\nthe model trained at the cost of more memory. Setting this to more than\nmax_iterations has the same effect as setting it to max_iterations.\n\nMaking predictions with missing dataOnce the model is created and ready to make predictions, it is quite common\nthat the input data to make predictions on are noisy. Turi Create can\nrecognize the following types of missing data (stored as None). Note that\nthe following options only apply to missing values during prediction or\nevaluation. Missing values during model creation raise an error.Missing values in individual features: Individual features including\nnumerical, categorical, list of numeric, and dictionary features may contain\nmissing data. The option missing_value_action determines the way in which\nthese features are handled. The default value value is\nmissing_value_action='impute' which imputes each of the features to the mean\nvalue observed during training. Setting missing_value_action='error' throws\nan error if any missing values are encountered during prediction.\n\nMissing feature columns: Sometimes, an entire column is missing while\nmaking predictions. In this case, missing_value_action='impute' imputes the\nmean value observed during training for each row in the input data. Again,\nsetting missing_value_action='error' throws an error if an entire feature\ncolumn is missing during prediction.\n\nNew categories in categorical features: New categories are often observed\nduring predict time. These new categories are treated to be the same as the\nreference category thus having no effect on the model prediction.\n\nNew keys in dictionary features: New keys in dictionary features during\npredict time are silently ignored and do not effect the prediction made.\n\n# Create a model with categorical and dictionary features.\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count',\n                                                'city',\n                                                'categories_dict'])\n\n# An SFrame with a single row with missing values in the 'user_avg_stars'\n# predict() will impute the entire feature to the mean value observed during training\nnew_data = tc.SFrame({'user_avg_stars': [None],\n                      'business_avg_stars': [30.0],\n                      'user_review_count': [10],\n                      'business_review_count': [20],\n                       'city': ['Tuscon'],\n                       'categories_dict': [{'Pizza': 1}]\n                      })\nprediction = model.predict(new_data)\nprint(prediction)\n\n# An SFrame without the 'user_avg_stars' feature. predict() will impute the\n# entire feature to the mean value observed during training.\nnew_data = tc.SFrame({'business_avg_stars': [30.0],\n                      'user_review_count': [10],\n                      'business_review_count': [20],\n                       'city': ['Tuscon'],\n                       'categories_dict': [{'Pizza': 1}]\n                      })\nprediction = model.predict(new_data)\n Regularizing Models (Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression)Regularization is the process of using problem structure to solve ill-posed\nproblems or to prevent overfitting. The structure is imposed by adding a penalty\nterm to the objective function. The linear regression module supports L1 and L2\nregularization, which are added to the loss function.As discussed above, the composite objective being optimized for is the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\n```\n\\min_{\\theta} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (\\theta^Tx - y_i)^2 + \\lambda_1 ||\\theta||_1\n```\n\n* \\lambda\\_2 \\|\\|\\theta\\|\\|^2\\_2\n  where \\lambda_1 is the l1_penalty and \\lambda_2 is the l2_penalty.# Lasso\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count'],\n                                    l1_penalty = 1.0,\n                                    l2_penalty = 0.0)\n\n# Ridge regression\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count'],\n                                    l2_penalty = 1.0)\n\n# Elastic net regression\nmodel = tc.linear_regression.create(train_data, target='stars',\n                                    features = ['user_avg_stars',\n                                                'business_avg_stars',\n                                                'user_review_count',\n                                                'business_review_count'],\n                                    l1_penalty = 1.0,\n                                    l2_penalty = 1.0)\n"},"supervised-learning/random_forest_regression.html":{"url":"supervised-learning/random_forest_regression.html","title":"Random Forest Regression","keywords":"","body":"Random Forest RegressionThe Random Forest is one of the most effective machine learning models\nfor predictive analytics, making it an industrial workhorse for machine\nlearning.BackgroundThe random forest model is a type of additive model that makes\npredictions by combining decisions from a sequence of base models. More\nformally we can write this class of models as:\n    g(x) = f_0(x) + f_1(x) + f_2(x) + ...\nwhere the final model g is the sum of simple base models f_i.\nHere, each base classifier is a simple decision\ntree.  This broad technique of using\nmultiple models to obtain better predictive performance is called model\nensembling.  In random\nforests, all the base models are constructed independently using a\ndifferent subsample of the data.Introductory ExampleIn this example, we will use the Mushrooms dataset.1import turicreate as tc\n\n# Load the data\ndata =  tc.SFrame.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/turicreate/master/src/unity/python/turicreate/test/mushroom.csv')\n\n# Label 'p' is edible\ndata['label'] = data['label'] == 'p'\n\n# Make a train-test split\ntrain_data, test_data = data.random_split(0.8)\n\n# Create a model.\nmodel = tc.random_forest_regression.create(train_data, target='label',\n                                           max_iterations=2,\n                                           max_depth =  3)\n\n# Save predictions to an SArray\npredictions = model.predict(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate the model and save the results into a dictionary\nresults = model.evaluate(test_data)\nTuning hyperparametersThis model has many tuning parameters. Here we provide a simple\nguideline for tuning the model.num_trees\nControls the number of trees in the final model. Usually the more trees, the\nhigher accuracy.  However, both the training and prediction time also grows\nlinearly in the number of trees.\nmax_depth\nRestricts the depth of each individual tree to prevent overfitting.\nstep_size\nAlso called shrinkage, appeared as the \\eta in the equations in the\nbackground section.  It works similar to the learning rate of the gradient\ndescent procedure: smaller value will take more iterations to reach the same\nlevel of training error of a larger step size.  So there is a trade off\nbetween step_size and number of iterations.\nmin_child_weight\nOne of the pruning criteria for decision tree construction. In classification\nproblem, this corresponds to the minimum observations required at a leaf\nnode. Larger value produces simpler trees.\nmin_loss_reduction\nAnother pruning criteria for decision tree construction. This restricts the\nreduction of loss function for a node split. Larger value produces simpler\ntrees.\nrow_subsample\nUse only a fraction of data at each iteration. This is similar to the\nmini-batch stochastic gradient\ndescent which not\nonly reduce the computation cost of each iteration, but may also produce more\nrobust model.\ncolumn_subsample\nUse only a subset of the columns to use at each iteration.\nIn general, you can choose num_trees to be as large as your computation\nbudget permits.  You can then set min_child_weight to be a reasonable value\naround (#instances/1000), and tune max_depth. When you have more training\ninstances, you can set max_depth to a higher value. When you find a large gap\nbetween the training loss and validation loss, a sign of overfitting, you may\nwant to reduce depth, and increase min_child_weight.Why choose random forests?Different kinds of models have different advantages. The random forest\nmodel is very good at handling tabular data with numerical features, or\ncategorical features with fewer than hundreds of categories. Unlike\nlinear models, random forests are able to capture non-linear interaction\nbetween the features and the target.One important note is that tree based models are not designed to work\nwith very sparse features. When dealing with sparse input data (e.g.\ncategorical features with large dimension), we can either pre-process\nthe sparse features to generate numerical statistics, or switch to a\nlinear model, which is better suited for such scenarios.Advanced FeaturesRefer to the earlier chapters for the following features:Using categorical features\n\nSparse features\n\nList features\n\nEvaluating Results\n\n"},"text/":{"url":"text/","title":"Text analysis","keywords":"","body":"Text analysisTuri Create. Applications for automated text analytics include:\nIn this chapter we will show how to do standard text analytics usingdetecting user sentiment regarding product reviews\n\ncreating features for use in other machine learning models\n\nunderstanding large collections of documents\n\nTopic Models\"Topic models\" are a class of statistical models for text data. These\nmodels typically assume documents can be described by a small set of\ntopics, and there is a probability of any word occurring for a given\n\"topic\".For example, suppose we are given the documents shown below, where the\nfirst document begins with the text \"The burrito was terrible. I...\" and\ncontinues with a long description of the eater's woes. A topic model\nattempts to do two things:Learn \"topics\": collections of words that co-occur in a meaningful way\n(as shown by the colored word clouds).\n\nLearn how much each document pertains to each topic. This is\nrepresented by the colored circles, where larger circles indicate\nlarger probabilities.\n\nThere are many variations of topic models that incorporate other sources\nof data, and there are a variety of algorithms for learning the\nparameters of the model from data. This section focuses on creating and\nusing topic models with Turi Create.Creating a modelThe following example includes the  SArray of documents that we created\nin previous sections: Each element represents a document in \"bag of\nwords\" representation -- a dictionary with word keys and whose values\nare the number of times that word occurred in the document. Once in this\nform, it is straightforward to learn a topic model.import turicreate as tc\n\ndocs = tc.SFrame('wikipedia_data')\n\n# Remove stop words and convert to bag of words\ndocs = tc.text_analytics.count_words(docs['X1'])\ndocs = docs.dict_trim_by_keys(tc.text_analytics.stop_words(), exclude=True)\n\n# Learn topic model\nmodel = tc.topic_model.create(docs)\nThere are a variety of additional arguments available which are covered in the API\n Reference.The two most commonly used arguments are:num_topics: Changes the number of topics to learn.\n\nnum_iterations: Changes how many iterations to perform.\n\nThe returned object is a TopicModel object, which exposes several useful\nmethods. For example,\nturicreate.topic_model.TopicModel.get_topics()\nreturns an SFrame containing the most probable words for each topic and\na score related to how high that word ranks for that topic.You may get details on a subset of topics by supplying a list of topic\nnames or topic indices, as well as restrict the number of words returned\nper topic.print(model.get_topics())\n+-------+--------+------------------+\n| topic |  word  |      score       |\n+-------+--------+------------------+\n|   0   | state  | 0.00781031634036 |\n|   0   |  team  | 0.0116096428466  |\n|   0   | league | 0.00734010266384 |\n|   0   | world  | 0.00707611127116 |\n|   0   | party  | 0.00693101676527 |\n|   1   |  area  | 0.00939951828831 |\n|   1   |  film  | 0.00903846641308 |\n|   1   | album  | 0.00810524480636 |\n|   1   | states | 0.00592481420794 |\n|   1   |  part  | 0.00591876305919 |\n+-------+--------+------------------+\n[50 rows x 3 columns]\nIf we just want to see the top words per topic, this code snippet will\nrearrange the above SFrame to do that.print(model.get_topics(output_type='topic_words'))\n+-------------------------------+\n|             words             |\n+-------------------------------+\n| [team, state, league, worl... |\n| [area, film, album, states... |\n| [city, family, war, built,... |\n| [united, american, state, ... |\n| [school, year, high, stati... |\n| [season, music, church, ye... |\n| [de, century, part, includ... |\n| [university, 2006, line, s... |\n| [age, population, people, ... |\n| [time, series, work, life,... |\n+-------------------------------+\nThe model object keeps track of various useful statistics about how the\nmodel was trained and its current status.Topic Model\n    Data:\n        Vocabulary size:     632779\n    Settings:\n        Number of topics:    10\n        alpha:               5.0\n        beta:                0.1\n        Iterations:          10\n        Training time:       7.2635\n        Verbose:             False\n    Accessible fields:\n        m['topics']          An SFrame containing the topics.\n        m['vocabulary']      An SArray containing the topics.\n    Useful methods:\n        m.get_topics()       Get the most probable words per topic.\n        m.predict(new_docs)  Make predictions for new documents.\n\nTo predict the topic of a given document, one can get an SArray of\nintegers containing the most probable topic ids:pred = model.predict(docs)\nCombining the above method with standard SFrame capabilities, one can\nuse predict to find documents related to a particular topicdocs_in_topic_0 = docs[model.predict(docs) == 0]\nor join with other data in order to analyze an author's typical topics\nor how topics change over time. For example, if we had author and\ntimestamp data, we could do the following:m = topic_model.create(doc_data['text'])\ndoc_data['topic'] = m.predict(doc_data['text'])\ndoc_data['author'][doc_data['topic'] == 1] # authors of docs in topic 1\nSometimes you want to know how certain the model's predictions are.

For\nthis situation, check out the parse_docword utility:docs = tc.text_analytics.parse_docword(doc_word_file, vocab_file)\nInitializing from other modelsIt is also easy to create a new topic model from an old one – whether it\nwas created using Turi Create or another package.new_model = tc.topic_model.create(docs,\n                                        num_topics=m['num_topics'],\n                                        initial_topics=m['topics'])\nSeeding the model with prior knowledgeTo manually fix several words to always be assigned to a topic, use the\nassociations argument. This can be useful for experimentation purposes.\nFor example, the following will ensure that \"season\" and \"club\" will\nhave a high probability under topic 1 and \"2008\" and \"2009\" will have a\nhigh probability under topic 2:associations = tc.SFrame({'word':['season', 'club', '2008', '2009'],\n                                'topic': [1, 1, 2, 2]})\nIf we fit a topic model using this option, we indeed find that \"season\"\nand \"club\" are present in topic 1, and we find other related words in\nthe same topic.m2 = tc.topic_model.create(docs,\n                           num_topics=20,\n                           num_iterations=50,\n                           associations=associations,\n                           verbose=False)\n\ntopics = m2.get_topics(num_words=10, output_type='topic_words')['words'][1]\n['season',\n 'club',\n 'league',\n 'played',\n 'won',\n 'football',\n 'world',\n 'cup',\n 'year',\n 'championship']\nm2.get_topics(num_words=10, output_type='topic_words')['words'][2]\n['team',\n '2008',\n 'game',\n '2009',\n '2007',\n '2010',\n 'final',\n 'player',\n '1',\n 'players']\nEvaluating topic modelsA common quantitative way to evaluate topic models is to split each\ndocument into a training set and a test set, learn a topic model on the\ntraining portion of each document, and compute the probability of the\nheld out word counts under the model. A slight variation of this\nprobability is called \"perplexity\". Lower values are better. Estimates\nof this quantity are provided during training. See\nturicreate.text_analytics.random_split,\nturicreate.topic_model.perplexity,\nTopicModel.evaluate\nfor helper functions to do this sort of evaluation on trained models.A common way to qualitatively evaluate topic models is to examine the\nmost probable words in each topic and count the number of words that do\nnot fit with the rest. If there are topics with words that do not\nco-occur in your corpus, you may want to try:removing stop words and other words that are not interesting to your analysis\n\nchanging the number of topics\n\nincreasing the number of iterations\n\nTo learn more check out the API\nReference."},"evaluation/":{"url":"evaluation/","title":"Evaluating models","keywords":"","body":"Evaluating modelsWhen evaluating models, choice of evaluation metrics is tied to the\nspecific machine learning task.

If you are trying to predict a score, such as Google’s daily\nstock price, then you might want to consider regression metrics like the\nroot mean-squared error (RMSE).

In this section, we will cover metrics for classification tasks. In binary classification, there are two possible output classes. In multi-class\nclassification, there are more than two possible classes.There are many ways of measuring classification performance:Accuracy\n\nConfusion matrix\n\nLog-loss\n\nPrecision and Recall\n\nF-Scores\n\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve\n\nArea under curve (AUC) (\"curve\" corresponds to the ROC curve)\n\nAccuracyAccuracy simply measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction.\nIt’s the ratio between the number of correct predictions and the total number\nof predictions (the number of test data points).\n    \\mbox{accuracy} = \\frac{\\mbox{# correct}}{\\mbox{# predictions}}\nimport turicreate as tc\n\ny    = tc.SArray([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"cat\"])\nyhat = tc.SArray([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\"])\n\nprint(tc.evaluation.accuracy(y, yhat))\n0.75\nAccuracy looks easy enough. However, it makes no distinction between classes;\ncorrect answers for each class are treated equally. Sometimes this is not\nenough. You might want to look at how many examples failed for each class.\nThis would be the case if the cost of misclassification is different, or if you\nhave a lot more test data of one class than the other. For instance, making the\ncall that a patient has cancer when he doesn’t (known as a false positive) has\nvery different consequences than making the call that a patient doesn’t have\ncancer when he does (a false negative).Multiclass AveragingThe multi-class setting is an extension of the binary setting. The accuracy\nmetrics can be \"averaged\" across all the classes in many possible ways. Some of\nthem are:micro: Calculate metrics globally by counting the total number of times\neach class was correctly predicted and incorrectly predicted.\n\nmacro: Calculate metrics for each \"class\" independently, and find their\nunweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.\n\nNone: Return a metric corresponding to each class, which is the \nprecision for each class.\n\nimport turicreate as tc\n\ny    = tc.SArray([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"foosa\", \"cat\"])\nyhat = tc.SArray([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\"])\n\nprint(tc.evaluation.accuracy(y, yhat, average = \"micro\"))\nprint(tc.evaluation.accuracy(y, yhat, average = \"macro\"))\nprint(tc.evaluation.accuracy(y, yhat, average = None))\n0.5\n0.6666666666666666\n{'foosa': None, 'dog': 0.5, 'cat': 0.5}\nIn general, when there are different numbers of examples per class, the average\nper-class accuracy will be different from the micro-average accuracy.  When the\nclasses are imbalanced, i.e., there are a lot more examples of one class than\nthe other, then the accuracy will give a very distorted picture, because the\nclass with more examples will dominate the statistic. In that case, you should\nlook at the average per-class accuracy (average=\"micro\"), as well as the\nindividual per-class accuracy numbers (average=None). Per-class accuracy is not\nwithout its own caveats, however: for instance, if there are very few examples of one\nclass, the test statistics for that class will be unreliable (i.e., they have\nlarge variance), so it’s not statistically sound to average quantities with\ndifferent degrees of variance.Note that the average parameter passed into tc.evaluation.accuracy\nmay be deprecated soon, and will break code that uses this API.Confusion matrixA confusion matrix (or confusion table) shows a more detailed breakdown of\ncorrect and incorrect classifications for each class. Here is an example of how\nthe confusion matrix can be computed.The confusion table is an SFrame consisting of three columns:target_label: The label of the ground truth.\n\npredicted_label: The predicted label.\n\ncount: The number of times the target_label was predicted as the\npredicted_label.\n\ny    = tc.SArray([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"foosa\", \"cat\"])\nyhat = tc.SArray([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\"])\n\ncf_matrix = tc.evaluation.confusion_matrix(y, yhat)\nColumns:\n    target_label    str\n    predicted_label    str\n    count    int\n\nRows: 4\n\nData:\n+--------------+-----------------+-------+\n| target_label | predicted_label | count |\n+--------------+-----------------+-------+\n|    foosa     |       cat       |   1   |\n|     cat      |       dog       |   1   |\n|     dog      |       dog       |   1   |\n|     cat      |       cat       |   1   |\n+--------------+-----------------+-------+\n[4 rows x 3 columns]\nLooking at the matrix, one can clearly get a better picture of which class the\nmodel best identifies. This information is lost if one only looks at the\noverall accuracy.Log-lossLog-loss, or logarithmic loss, gets into the finer details of a classifier. In\nparticular, if the raw output of the classifier is a numeric probability\ninstead of a class label, then log-loss can be used. The probability\nessentially serves as a gauge of confidence. If the true label is \"0\" but the\nclassifier thinks it belongs to class \"1\" with probability 0.51, then the\nclassifier would be making a mistake. But it’s a near miss because the\nprobability is very close to the decision boundary of 0.5. Log-loss is a “soft”\nmeasurement of accuracy that incorporates this idea of probabilistic\nconfidence.Mathematically, log-loss for a binary classifier looks like this:\n\\mbox{log-loss} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - p_i)\nHere, p_i is the probability that the i-th data point belongs to class \"1\",\nas judged by the classifier. y_i is the true label and is either \"0\" or\n\"1\".  The beautiful thing about this definition is that it is intimately tied\nto information theory: Intuitively, log-loss measures the unpredictability of\nthe “extra noise” that comes from using a predictor as opposed to the true\nlabels.  By minimizing the cross entropy, we maximize the accuracy of the\nclassifier.Here is an example of how this is computed:import turicreate as tc\n\ntargets = tc.SArray([0, 1, 1, 0])\npredictions = tc.SArray([0.1, 0.35, 0.7, 0.99])\n\nlog_loss = tc.evaluation.log_loss(targets, predictions)\n1.5292569425208318\nLogloss is undefined when a probability value p_i = 0, or p_i = 1.\nHence, probabilities are clipped to \\max(\\epsilon, \\min(1 - \\epsilon, p_i))\nwhere \\epsilon=1.0 \\times 10^{-15}Multi-class log-lossIn the multi-class setting, log-loss requires a vector of probabilities (that\nsum to 1) for each class label in the input dataset. In this example, there are\nthree classes [0, 1, 2], and the vector of probabilities correspond to the\nprobability of prediction for each of the three classes (while maintaining\nordering).targets    = tc.SArray([ 1, 0, 2, 1])\npredictions = tc.SArray([[.1, .8, 0.1],\n                        [.9, .1, 0.0],\n                        [.8, .1, 0.1],\n                        [.3, .6, 0.1]])\n\nlog_loss = tc.evaluation.log_loss(targets, predictions)\n0.785478695933018\nFor multi-class classification, when the target label is of type string,\nthen the probability vector is assumed to be a vector of probabilities of class\nas sorted alphanumerically. Hence, for the probability vector [0.1, 0.2, 0.7]\nfor a dataset with classes [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"rat\"; the 0.1 refers to \"cat\", 0.2\nrefers to \"dog\", and 0.7 to \"rat\".target    = tc.SArray([ \"dog\", \"cat\", \"foosa\", \"dog\"])\npredictions = tc.SArray([[.1, .8, 0.1],\n                        [.9, .1, 0.0],\n                        [.8, .1, 0.1],\n                        [.3, .6, 0.1]])\nlog_loss = tc.evaluation.log_loss(y, yhat)\n1.5292569425208318\nPrecision & RecallPrecision and recall are actually two metrics. But they are often used\ntogether. Precision answers the question: Out of the items that the classifier\npredicted to be true, how many are actually true? Whereas, recall answers the\nquestion: Out of all the items that are true, how many are found to\nbe true by the classifier?The precision score quantifies the ability of a classifier to not label a\nnegative example as positive. The precision score can be interpreted as\nthe probability that a positive prediction made by the classifier is\npositive.  The score is in the range [0,1] with 0 being the worst, and 1\nbeing perfect.The precision and recall scores can be defined as:\\mbox{precision} = \\frac{\\mbox{# true positive}}{\\mbox{#true positive + #false positive}}\\mbox{recall} = \\frac{\\mbox{# true positive}}{\\mbox{#true positive + #false negative}}targets = turicreate.SArray([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])\npredictions = turicreate.SArray([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])\n\npr_score   = turicreate.evaluation.precision(targets, predictions)\nrec_score  = turicreate.evaluation.recall(targets, predictions)\nprint pr_score, rec_score\n0.25, 0.5\nPrecision can also be defined then the target classes are of type string.\nFor binary classification, when the target label is of type string, then\nthe labels are sorted alphanumerically and the largest label is considered the\n\"positive\" label.targets = turicreate.SArray(['cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'cat'])\npredictions = turicreate.SArray(['dog', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog'])\n\npr_score   = turicreate.evaluation.precision(targets, predictions)\nrec_score  = turicreate.evaluation.recall(targets, predictions)\nprint(pr_score, rec_score)\n0.25, 0.5\nMulti-class precision-recallPrecision and recall scores can also be defined in the multi-class setting.\nHere, the metrics can be \"averaged\" across all the classes in many possible\nways. Some of them are:micro: Calculate metrics globally by counting the total number of times\neach class was correctly predicted and incorrectly predicted.\n\nmacro: Calculate metrics for each \"class\" independently, and find their\nunweighted mean.

Undefined Precision-Recall \nThe precision (or recall) score is not defined when the number of true positives + false positives (true positives + false negatives) is zero. In\nother words, then the denominators of the respective equations are 0, the\nmetrics are not defined. In those settings, we return a value of None. In the\nmulti-class setting, the None is skipped during averaging.F-scores (F1, F-beta)The F1-score is a single metric that combines both precision and recall via\ntheir harmonic mean:F_1 = 2 \\frac{\\mbox{precision} * \\mbox{recall}}{\\mbox{precision + recall}}The score lies in the range [0,1] with 1 being ideal and 0 being the worst.\nUnlike the arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean tends toward the smaller of the\ntwo elements.  Hence the F1 score will be small if either precision or recall\nis small.The F1-score (sometimes known as the balanced F-beta score), is a special case\nof a metric known as the F-Beta score, which measures the effectiveness of\nretrieval with respect to a user who attaches \\beta times as much\nimportance to recall as to precision.F_\\beta = (1 + \\beta^2) \\frac{\\mbox{precision} * \\mbox{recall}}{\\mbox{\\beta^2 precision + recall}}.targets = turicreate.SArray([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0])\npredictions = turicreate.SArray([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])\n\nf1    = turicreate.evaluation.f1_score(targets, predictions)\nfbeta = turicreate.evaluation.fbeta_score(targets, predictions, beta = 2.0)\nprint(f1, fbeta)\n0.333333333333 0.416666666667\nLike the other metrics, the F1-score (or F-beta score) can also be defined when\nthe target classes are of type string.  For binary classification, when the\ntarget label is of type string, then the labels are sorted alphanumerically\nand the largest label is considered the \"positive\" label.targets = turicreate.SArray(['cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'cat'])\npredictions = turicreate.SArray(['dog', 'cat', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog', 'cat', 'dog'])\n\nf1    = turicreate.evaluation.f1_score(targets, predictions)\nfbeta = turicreate.evaluation.fbeta_score(targets, predictions, beta = 2.0)\nprint(f1, fbeta)\n0.333333333333 0.416666666667\nMulti-class F-scoresF-scores can also be defined in the multi-class setting.  Here, the metrics can\nbe \"averaged\" across all the classes in many possible ways. Some of them are:micro: Calculate metrics globally by counting the total number of times\neach class was correctly predicted and incorrectly predicted.\n\nmacro: Calculate metrics for each \"class\" independently, and find their\nunweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.\n\nNone: Return the accuracy score for each class.corresponding to each\nclass.\n\nNote: The micro average precision, recall, and accuracy scores are\nmathematically equivalent.Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC Curve)In statistics, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), or ROC curve, is a\ngraphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system\nas its prediction threshold is varied. The ROC curve provides nuanced\ndetails about the behavior of the classifier.  The curve is created by plotting\nthe true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at\nvarious threshold settings.This exotic sounding name originated in the 1950s from radio signal analysis,\nand was made popular by a 1978 paper by Charles Metz called \"Basic Principles\nof ROC analysis.\" The ROC curve shows the sensitivity of the classifier by\nplotting the rate of true positives to the rate of false positives. In other\nwords, it shows you how many correct positive classifications can be gained as\nyou allow for more and more false positives.  The perfect classifier that makes\nno mistakes would hit a true positive rate of 100% immediately, without\nincurring any false positives. This almost never happens in practice.A good ROC curve has a lot of space under it (because the true positive rate\nshoots up to 100% very quickly). A bad ROC curve covers very little area.targets = turicreate.SArray([0, 1, 1, 0])\npredictions = turicreate.SArray([0.1, 0.35, 0.7, 0.99])\n\nroc_curve = turicreate.evaluation.roc_curve(targets, predictions)\nData:\n+-----------+-----+-----+---+---+\n| threshold | fpr | tpr | p | n |\n+-----------+-----+-----+---+---+\n|    0.0    | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   1e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   2e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   3e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   4e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   5e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   6e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   7e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   8e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n|   9e-05   | 1.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 2 |\n+-----------+-----+-----+---+---+\n[100001 rows x 5 columns]\nThe result of the roc curve is a multi-column SFrame with the following\ncolumns:tpr: True positive rate, the number of true positives divided by the number of positives.\n\nfpr: False positive rate, the number of false positives divided by the number of negatives.\n\np: Total number of positive values.\n\nn: Total number of negative values.\n\nclass: Reference class for this ROC curve (for multi-class classification).\n\nNote: The ROC curve is computed using a binned histogram and hence always\ncontains 100K rows.

The ROC curve can also be defined in the multi-class\nsetting by returning a single curve for each class.Area under the curve (AUC)AUC stands for Area Under the Curve. Here, the curve is the ROC curve. As\nmentioned above, a good ROC curve has a lot of space under it (because the true\npositive rate shoots up to 100% very quickly). A bad ROC curve covers very\nlittle area.targets = turicreate.SArray([0, 1, 1, 0])\npredictions = turicreate.SArray([0.1, 0.35, 0.7, 0.99])\n\nauc = turicreate.evaluation.auc(targets, predictions)\nprint(auc)\n0.5\nNote: The AUC score is computed using a binned histogram and hence always\ncontains 100K rows.

For binary classification, when the target label is of type\nstring, then the labels are sorted alphanumerically and the largest label\nis considered the \"positive\" label.targets = turicreate.SArray([\"cat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"dog\"])\npredictions = turicreate.SArray([0.1, 0.35, 0.7, 0.99])\n\nauc = turicreate.evaluation.auc(targets, predictions)\nprint(auc)\n0.5\nMulti-class area under curveThe AUC score can also be defined in the multi-class setting.  Here, the\nmetrics can be \"averaged\" across all the classes in many possible ways. Some of\nthem are:macro: Calculate metrics for each \"class\" independently, and find their\nunweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.\n\nNone: Return a metric corresponding to each class.\n\nCalibration curveA calibration curve that compares the true probability of an event with its\npredicted probability. This chart shows if the  created model has well\n\"calibrated\" probability predictions. The closer the calibration curve is to\nthe \"ideal\" curve, the more confident one can be in interpreting the\nprobability predictions as a confidence score for predicting churn.The graph is constructed by segmenting the probability space, from 0.0 to 1.0,\ninto a fixed number of discrete steps. For instance, for a step size of 0.1,\nthe probability space would be divided into 10 buckets: [0.0, 0.1), [0.1, 0.2)\n... [0.9, 1.0]. Given a set of events for which a predicted probability has\nbeen computed, each predicted probability is rounded to the appropriate bucket.\nAn aggregation is then performed to compute the total number of data points\nwithin each probability range along with fraction of those data points that\nwere truly positive events. The calibration curve plots the fraction of events\nthat were truly positive for each probability bucket. A perfectly calibrated\nmodel, the curve would be a line from (0.0, 0.0) to (1.0, 1.0).Consider a simple example of a binary classification problem where a model\nwas created to predict a click or no-click event. If an event was “clicked”,\nand had a predicted probability of 0.345, using a binning of 0.1, the “number\nof events” for bin [0.3, 0.4) would be increased by one, and the “number of\ntrue” events would be increased by one. If an event with probability 0.231 was\n“not clicked”, the “number of events” for bin [0.2, 0.3) would be increased by\none, while the “number of true” events would not be increased. For each bin,\nthe “number of true” over the “total number of events” becomes the observed\nprobability (y-axis value). The average predicted probability for the bin\nbecomes the x-axis value.Precision-Recall CurveThe precision-recall curve plots the inherent trade-off between precision and\nrecall. It is easier to understand and interpret this curve by understanding\neach of the components of this curve at different \"thresholds\".Consider a simple example of a binary classification problem where a\nmodel was created to predict a click or no-click event. If an event was\n“clicked”, Looking at the confusion matrix, the model predictions can be\nbroken down into four categories:Events that were predicted to be \"click\" and were actually \"click\" events\n(True Positive, TP).\n\nEvents that were predicted to be \"not-click\" but were not \"click\" events\n(False Positive, FP).\n\nEvents that were predicted to be \"not-click\" and were actually \"not-click\"\nevents (True Negative, TN).\n\nEvents that were predicted to be \"click\" but were actually \"not-click\" events\n(False Negative, FN).\n\nAs defined earlier, precision is fraction of predicted click events that were\nactually click events while recall is the fraction of click events that were\ncorrectly predicted by the model. The definitions of precision and recall are\nnot necessarily discrete events and can depend on the prediction probabilities.\nOne can define a \"threshold\" of probability above which the model prediction\ncan be considered a \"click\" prediction.For example, a \"threshold\" of 0.5 implies that all probability predictions\nabove 0.5 are considered \"click\" events and all predictions below are\nconsidered \"not-click\" events. By varying the threshold between 0.0 and 1.0, we\ncan compute different precision and recall numbers. At a threshold of 0.0 all\nthe model predictions are \"click\". At this point, the model exhibits perfect\nrecall but has the worst possible precision. At a threshold of 1.0, the model\npredicts every event as \"not-click\"; this is prefect precision (the model was\nnever wrong at predicting clicks!) but the worst possible recall.This by plotting precision and recall at various thresholds, the\nprecision-recall curve illustrates the trade-off of precision and recall for\nthe model, at varying thresholds. Two models can be compared easily by plotting\ntheir precision-recall curve. A curve that is more to the top-right hand side\nof the plot represents a better model."},"conclusion.html":{"url":"conclusion.html","title":"Additional Resources","keywords":"","body":"Additional ResourcesWe hope you have enjoyed learning about how to use Turi Create.

Before proceeding to use the C++ API, run ./configure to set up the build system for the project, and run make -j8 from within release/src/unity to build the library artifacts that your application will depend on.Currently, the C++ API is not packaged for easy consumption outside of the Turi Create Python package. As a result, some care is needed when compiling and linking against Turi Create. This may cause compatibility issues since those compilation and linking flags may not be compatible with flags used elsewhere. Required compilation flags for your project include:-std=c++11 - some headers exposed by Turi Create require the use of C++11 or later.\n\n-stdlib=libc++ - may be needed on macOS (probably not on Linux).\n\nAssuming  refers to the location where you cloned the Turi Create repository, the following directories must be added to the include paths with -I, and to the link paths with -L:-I/turicreate/src\n\n-I/turicreate/src/external\n\n-I/turicreate/deps/local/include\n\n-I/turicreate/src/external/armadillo/include\n\n-L/turicreate/release/src/unity\n\n\nDepending on your compiler toolchain, the following defines may be needed (note: these are autodetected for Turi Create itself with ./configure, but the values must be passed on to your own build process):\n-DHASH_FOR_UINT128_DEFINED - set this if your compiler toolchain supports unsigned __int128.\n\n-DHASH_FOR_INT128_DEFINED - set this if your compiler toolchain supports __int128.\n\n-lunity_shared to link against libunity_shared.so.\n\n/turicreate/release/src/unity/libunity.a to statically link libunity.a into your project. Note that this is needed in addition to the dynamic library listed above.\n\nExample: make predictions in C++ from a model trained in PythonLet's assume we're starting with the model from the introductory example in the boosted trees classifier section of the user guide. The model is available as mushroom.tcmodel.zip.To make predictions from this model in Python, you could run:import turicreate as tc\ndata =  tc.SFrame.read_csv('turicreate/lfs/datasets/xgboost/mushroom.csv')\nmodel = tc.load_model('mushroom.tcmodel')\ndata[0]\n{'bruises?': 't',\n 'cap-color': 'n',\n 'cap-shape': 'x',\n 'cap-surface': 's',\n 'gill-attachment': 'f',\n 'gill-color': 'k',\n 'gill-size': 'n',\n 'gill-spacing': 'c',\n 'habitat': 'u',\n 'label': 'c',\n 'odor': 'p',\n 'population': 's',\n 'ring-number': 'o',\n 'ring-type': 'p',\n 'spore-print-color': 'k',\n 'stalk-color-above-ring': 'w',\n 'stalk-color-below-ring': 'w',\n 'stalk-root': 'e',\n 'stalk-shape': 'e',\n 'stalk-surface-above-ring': 's',\n 'stalk-surface-below-ring': 's',\n 'veil-color': 'w',\n 'veil-type': 'p'}\nmodel.predict_topk(data[0], k=2, output_type='probability')\nColumns:\n    id    int\n    class    int\n    probability    float\n\nRows: 2\n\nData:\n+----+-------+---------------+\n| id | class |  probability  |\n+----+-------+---------------+\n| 0  |   1   | 0.57558375597 |\n| 0  |   0   | 0.42441624403 |\n+----+-------+---------------+\n[2 rows x 3 columns]\nIn C++, the equivalent code would be (minus the CSV parsing):// standard C++ includes\n#include \n\n// Turi Create includes\n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n  // set up registry of named functions and models\n  // used for rehydrating saved models\n  auto fn_reg = turi::toolkit_function_registry();\n  turi::register_functions(fn_reg);\n  auto class_reg = turi::toolkit_class_registry();\n  turi::register_models(class_reg);\n\n  // create a global context\n  auto global = turi::unity_global(&fn_reg, &class_reg);\n\n  // load the model from disk\n  auto loaded_model = global.load_model(\"mushroom.tcmodel\");\n  std::string name = turi::variant_get_value(loaded_model[\"model_name\"]);\n  std::cout (\n    turi::variant_get_value>(loaded_model[\"model\"])\n  );\n\n  // set up input\n  // (note: can do batch prediction by adding more than one row to rows)\n  std::vector rows;\n  turi::flex_dict row;\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"bruises?\", \"t\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"cap-color\", \"n\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"cap-shape\", \"x\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"cap-surface\", \"s\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"gill-attachment\", \"f\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"gill-color\", \"k\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"gill-size\", \"n\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"gill-spacing\", \"c\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"habitat\", \"u\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"odor\", \"p\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"population\", \"s\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"ring-number\", \"o\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"ring-type\", \"p\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"spore-print-color\", \"k\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"stalk-color-above-ring\", \"w\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"stalk-color-below-ring\", \"w\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"stalk-root\", \"e\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"stalk-shape\", \"e\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"stalk-surface-above-ring\", \"s\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"stalk-surface-below-ring\", \"s\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"veil-color\", \"w\"));\n  row.push_back(std::make_pair(\"veil-type\", \"p\"));\n  rows.push_back(row);\n\n  // make prediction\n  turi::gl_sframe result = model->fast_predict_topk(\n      // input data - 1 row per prediction\n      rows,\n\n      // output type - see https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/3490286b27ff5d79cb90d09fe026d5671ce990c7/src/unity/toolkits/supervised_learning/supervised_learning.hpp#L47\n      \"probability\",\n\n      // missing value action - see https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/3490286b27ff5d79cb90d09fe026d5671ce990c7/src/ml_data/ml_data_column_modes.hpp#L27\n      \"error\",\n\n      // k (returns top k predictions) -- must be ();
